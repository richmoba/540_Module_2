Charlotte city council is voting to move the Greyhound bus station less than a mile from campus for 5+ years,"https://twitter.com/JoeBrunoWSOC9/status/1695132096648323465?t=JulXOJJ3MEB3afZO5qBwZQ&s=19

I hate to be the guy that complains about crime, but Greyhound stations tend to bring a lot of riff raff. It feels like the city is dumping the bus station onto University City to try and fix some of the problems Uptown. 

Could you imagine the outrage if they tried to put this station in Ballentyne, South Park, or Meyers Park?

University City was finally starting to get some good development too near the light rail. I can't imagine this bus station will bring new bars and restaurants, most likely the opposite will happen.",1692991829.0,bigsquid69,"Charlotte city council is voting to move the Greyhound bus station less than a mile from campus for 5+ years https://twitter.com/JoeBrunoWSOC9/status/1695132096648323465?t=JulXOJJ3MEB3afZO5qBwZQ&s=19

An Open Letter to UNCC:

I write this letter alone in my room, the space where I have so carefully confined myself to for the past five months. The same place I was told would be the safest place to do my job. The same place where I completed ten credit hours successfully during the summer semester. The same place I was sent in March when there were an estimated 300 COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, when Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency, closing our university. 
I sit here today in the same state, only now I am surrounded by 1,972 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Yet, I am expected to return to campus in 18 days. I, along with the majority of the country, have lived in fear for almost half of a year. I have awakened every single day since March wondering which of my friends will be the next to contract the virus, wondering which of my high-risk parents would be more likely to survive this sickness, wondering if that tightness in my chest is particles in my lungs which will render me sick and permanently crippled or if it is just anxiety. I wake up each day wondering which grocery store trip will be the one that kills me. I am so used to this constant state of worry now that these fears plaguing my head are my new normal. However, I have never felt this trepidation as strongly as I do today. 
On Monday, August 10th, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill hosted its first day of class for the fall 2020 semester. Within one week, UNC’s COVID-19 case count rose by 135 cases, according to the school’s paper, The Daily Tarheel. This rise in positivity was not-so-shockingly 5 times the positivity rate from the prior week. Let’s take a moment to discuss these numbers: The 135 cases recorded only account for the positive test results of students. This number does not include those who were not tested, those who potentially received false negatives, or those who came into contact with each of these 135 individuals and now have to isolate or quarantine. After this whopping spike in cases, UNC’s students pushed the university to move to an all-online semester through petitions and articles. 
On Monday, August 10th, North Carolina State University hosted its first day of classes for the fall semester. Since this day, over 500 students have been ordered to isolate or quarantine. Today, on August 20th, NC State announced it would also be moving to an all-online semester beginning August 24th. Are we seeing the pattern?
On Monday, September 7th, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte will be hosting its first day of classes. If UNCC officials act today to move the fall semester online, we could break this pattern. We have the power now to avoid the countless impending cases and deaths of members of our own institution. We have the time now to fully prepare each course to fit an online setting; a luxury NC State and UNC Chapel Hill do not have. 
I am writing this letter as a cry for help; to ask my university to call off in-person classes for the sake of my peers, my professors, the entirety of the staff, and for the sake of our city as a whole. I have stayed home, I have distanced myself from both my family and my friends for their protection and mine, and I have worn a mask each time I have had to venture into public. I have done my part. Now, it is time to do yours.",1598053140.0,Madd-scientits,"Sign this petition to UNCC for an online semester!!! [Petition to UNCC link](https://www.change.org/OnlineUNCC)

University City Food Tiers,"***Note***: all of these opinions are my own and are an honest reflection of a few of food spots in the University area. I am only considering spots very close to campus.\*

**God Tier:**

\- Le Kebab Mediterranean Grill: my whole heart. I love you. Great shawarma wraps and rice

\- Halal Food Cart: fantastic food, but the only downside is that it's cash only

**Great Choices:**

\- Cava: my go-to for an easy meal. Always get the free pita

\- Cookout: Big Double, cajun fries, chicken quesadilla, and an Oreo Mint milkshake (please don't shame me)

\- Passage to India: probably the best Indian food I've had in Charlotte, but they have been closed for dine-in

\- IKEA food court: I love Swedish meat balls and its decent value + hide and seek

\- Chick-Fil-A (off-campus): decent, but I'm still salty that they don't have regular strips anymore. Biscuits are burt sometimes but

\- ISHI: really good food, but the dining room was closed the last time. A little pricey compared to my go-to Japanese at home

**Mid:**

\- Zapata's: decent food, free chips, and a nice atmosphere

\- Monterrey: really cheap for lunch and has decent lunch specials. Huge portions

\- Chipotle: a classic, but they charge for tortillas now so that's lame

\- Noodles and Co: I like it, but I have to be in a special mood for it

\- Blaze Pizza: pretty good food but meh value IMO

\- Panera: decent food but it's a little bland

\- Chili's: you can eat like a king for $10.99. I like that.

\- Outback: average steaks and apps, but their Alice Springs chicken is pretty nice

\- Five Guys: 8/10 burger, but waaaaay too expensive. Free peanuts are a plus if you're not allergic

\- McDonald's: a constant, but rarely eat it

**Trash:**

\- Domino's: was low-mid until they got rid of NINER50. Now I'm just butthurt.

\- Mi Pueblo: average food and pretty small portion size. The only time I've been they had a DJ and it was entirely too loud and crazy busy. Maybe good for hosting a large group?

\- Piada Italian Street Food: I tried this one today and I was really disappointed. Their specialty items were a disappointment and it was really expensive for what it was. Chicken was burnt.

SGA Update 7/28,"Hey Y'all,

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I wanted to provide some updates with things going on around SGA and the University. I know I promised an in-depth update regarding Delta and how it potentially impacts university operations, and I promise you it is still on its way. In addition to meetings with the Safety and Security department today, I also have meetings set up with both our Emergency Management Director Chris Gonyar and Chancellor Gaber tomorrow, so the in depth post will be coming tomorrow evening following those meetings. As much as I hate delaying the in depth post another day, I felt waiting until after talking to Chris and Chancellor Gaber was the most prudent decision in order to provide the most accurate picture and best be able to address any questions or concerns you may have. For now I wanted to give a brief overview of other topics so tomorrows post could be focused directly on Delta.

&#x200B;

**Fall 2021 Reopening Plans-** This is the brief version. As of this email, the University continues to plan with a relatively normal fall semester. It is important for us to remember however that we are not quite out of this pandemic yet. Concerns surrounding the Delta variant threaten our shared efforts to return to normal. To that end, **I strongly encourage all students who have not yet done so to get the safe and widely available COVID-19 vaccine. Receiving this vaccine is the best way we as students can do our part to ensure a normal and fun school year**. Once you receive the vaccine, be sure to let the school know by completing the [COVID-19 Vaccine Reporting Form](https://ninernationcares.uncc.edu/updated-faqs-fall-semester) by clicking on the blue box in the top left corner. As mentioned above, I will give a more in depth update regarding this topic tomorrow.

&#x200B;

**What’s In Store For Sophomores-** Sophomore Class President Leo Cruz Cruz and the Sophomore Class Council will be hosting a series of Zoom calls every Wednesday at 6:00 pm from July 28th to August 18th. This is a great opportunity for rising Sophomores to learn more about how to get plugged in with the university and the city of Charlotte. You can hop on using [this link](https://uncc.zoom.us/s/96801018663). We hope to see you out here as we get ready for another school year!

&#x200B;

**Fall Elections-** Student Government will be holding fall elections for a variety of Senate positions and Freshman Class President this fall. There are opportunities for all students to get involved regardless of class standing or previous Student Government experience. While more information will be coming out later, I wanted to share with you [this interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y1BdH0OmKocuWlh03HInM0QZE0w64i5NxElcBiHYiN0/edit?ts=60fef2b6). If you are passionate about students, want to make a difference around campus, and are looking for leadership opportunities, we would love to have you in our organization. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the Attorney General Abigail Warren at [awarre48@uncc.edu](mailto:awarre48@uncc.edu). She will be overseeing elections and would be more than happy to help you as much as she can.

&#x200B;

**Additional Opportunities-** I also wanted to share some additional opportunities for students to get involved with Student Government. We have a number of initiatives we want to see accomplished, but we can’t do it alone. Opportunities currently exist to serve on the Senior Class Council, and applications can be found [using this link.](https://ninerengage.uncc.edu/submitter/form/start/482592) Additionally, we are currently accepting applications to serve on the Police and Public Safety Student Advisory Board. This is a great opportunity to engage in shared governance regarding safety procedures and practices on our campus and I would encourage you to consider applying [here.](https://ninerengage.uncc.edu/submitter/form/start/469798)

&#x200B;

I appreciate your patience as I continue to meet with University administrators and work through the threat posed by Delta. Just yesterday I cut my vacation in Florida short so that I could drive 10 hours back to Charlotte to meet about this topic with various people in person. I am doing everything I can to advocate for a normal fall experience, and the best way you can help with that is by getting the vaccine. If you've already got it, great. Let the school know. If you've already let the school know, even better. Talk to your circle about getting the vaccine. More information will come tomorrow so that I can provide you with the most accurate, up to date information I have. In the meantime, please continue to enjoy a safe summer. As always, thank you for the privilege of serving as your Student Body President, and Go Niners.

Opportunities currently exist to serve on the Senior Class Council, and applications can be found [using this link.](https://ninerengage.uncc.edu/submitter/form/start/482592) Additionally, we are currently accepting applications to serve on the Police and Public Safety Student Advisory Board. This is a great opportunity to engage in shared governance regarding safety procedures and practices on our campus and I would encourage you to consider applying [here.](https://ninerengage.uncc.edu/submitter/form/start/469798)

I appreciate your patience as I continue to meet with University administrators and work through the threat posed by Delta. Just yesterday I cut my vacation in Florida short so that I could drive 10 hours back to Charlotte to meet about this topic with various people in person. I am doing everything I can to advocate for a normal fall experience, and the best way you can help with that is by getting the vaccine. If you've already got it, great. Let the school know. If you've already let the school know, even better. Talk to your circle about getting the vaccine. More information will come tomorrow so that I can provide you with the most accurate, up to date information I have. In the meantime, please continue to enjoy a safe summer. As always, thank you for the privilege of serving as your Student Body President, and Go Niners.

Incoming Freshman SOAR/Registration Guide,"I’ve been seeing the sub be absolutely floored with the same and similar type questions so I figured why not make one post with answers to the questions we all used to have. I’m ngl it’s kind of annoying but we’ve all been there so I sympathize. Other upper class men please feel free to add on in the comments any info you feel is important or if you believe I am incorrect about something!

I agree with other commenters who say that they really should not be letting you all register for classes before SOAR. But regardless it’s happening. 

In order to have access to sign up for classes, you must first choose and sign up for a SOAR date. Once you do, you’ll have access to the pre-course modules which you should ACTUALLY pay attention too, especially at the end of when it talks about registration. 

To know what classes you need to do for your major, you need to look at Degree Works. Log into ninernet and click the big button that says Degree Works. You should check these classes with the Catalog.

The Catalog shows every major and minor the university offers and what classes are required for it. Make sure you are using the one for 2022-2023. To find your major, click your college, and then choose the major or minor you’re looking for. You can also use the search button but sometimes those search results are too many to sift through.

If you are unhappy with your math placement level, you can take the math placement test to try and raise it. It cannot be lowered. Math placement is assigned by SAT/ACT score. If you have an AP credit you can send it in to raise it. If you did not take SAT/ACT in high school, you are required to take it. If you do not, you will be automatically assigned to the lowest math available, 900 I believe. This can set you behind in your major. I knew a girl last year who didn’t take the test and had to take 3 math classes total before she could access the rest of the courses in her major. Unless she took that 3rd math this summer, she still won’t be able to take any of the classes in her major in the fall, and will have to wait until spring.

The first year writing course is required, like actually required. You must take WRDS 1103 or WRDS 1104 to satisfy this requirement. Placement for that is assigned based on sat/act score, or high school gpa. You can choose to take 1103 if you are assigned to 1104, but as far as I know, you can’t move up to 1104. You are only exempt if you scored above a 3 on the AP Lang exam.

When it says “main/uptown campus” on the location, that means the regular campus. It will say “center city” if it isn’t on campus, and I personally haven’t seen a single class listed at “center city”, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. 

If you need to calculate whether you can make it from one building to another on time, use Google maps. Type in the exact building name. If it doesn’t come up at first, search the university, then move around the map to find the building. Then choose “walk” and it gives a pretty accurate reflection of how long it will take you to make it from one building to the next. This can be done on your phone or on Google maps on your laptop, which apparently a lot of people didn’t know was a thing. 

Classes on MWF are typically 50 minutes and TTh are 1:15 minutes. Please keep in mind I’ve said TYPICALLY, this does not mean every class. But that is the usual schedule. There’s about 15 minutes between usual class endings and beginnings every day. 

There is a list of building abbreviations as well that’s helpful to see.

I HIGHLY recommend looking at ratemyprofessor. It gives pretty accurate reviews, but don’t just look at average rating. Actually READ the reviews so you see how the class is taught and if it’s something you’ll be able to manage. Also look at how many people have rated a 5,4,3,2,1. I thought rmp was common knowledge but my boyfriend didn’t know about until second semester so I figured I’d drop it here too.

Believe what they say when they say 8am’s in college are different than in high school. If you are someone that enjoys mornings, and can wake up and get out of bed easily, good that’s for you. If not, don’t even think about taking an 8 am, don’t even consider it. 10 am is your best bet. 

Lastly, don’t trust your advisors. I may get some hate for this, but advisors have other jobs, their main job is not advising students. They do not have your best interest at heart, they have getting advising done so they can focus more on getting their actual job done in mind. If your advisor tells you to take something that seems unnecessary, check your degree works and the catalog to see if it actually is. Personally I double check all the information my advisor gives me anyways, he was wrong a few times. You don’t HAVE to take the classes your advisor tells you to take, this isn’t high school you won’t get into any trouble for it. 

For example, I was failing a class my first semester, my Prospect for Success class. My advisor asked to meet with me cause he wanted to know why I was failing. I explained and he asked me why I didn’t withdraw from the class. I said because it fulfilled my prospect for success requirement, to which he said “no it doesn’t, that requirement doesn’t actually exist, we’re just supposed to tell you it does and strongly encourage it.” to which I almost ended the zoom call right then and there. 

I know as a university college (undecided) major PFS is required but if you are a Colege of Liberal Arts and Sciences major PROSPECT FOR SUCCESS IS NOT REQUIRED AND A WASTE OF YOUR TIME I PASSED THE CLASS BUT IT WAS THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE FOR THE ENTIRE SEMESTER AND IVE NEVER HATED A CLASS MORE IN MY LIFE. SERIOUSLY. 

Basically, if your advisor says something is required or you have to take something, look into it, and come back and ask “is this actually required, or are you just required to strongly recommend it to me?”

These answers are all true to the best of my knowledge, but as everything on the internet, take it with a grain of salt. If y’all have anymore questions leave them down below and I’ll try and find out if I don’t know the answer. I’ll be making one of these about housing soon too so if you have a question about that too, feel free to drop it and go niners :)",1654654309.0,obviouslypretty,"Incoming Freshman SOAR/Registration Guide I’ve been seeing the sub be absolutely floored with the same and similar type questions so I figured why not make one post with answers to the questions we all used to have.

SGA Update 11/2,"Hey Y'all,

&#x200B;

For those of you who do not know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman (peep the new username). I currently serve as the Pro Tempore of the Student Senate within the Student Government Association. Before I begin, I want to make clear that the views and opinions I express are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect that of SGA's as a whole or UNC Charlotte.

&#x200B;

I got on here a few days ago and provided an update regarding Pass/No Credit. Other than that though, it has been a minute since I've provided an update, so I thought I'd share some of the things Student Government has been working on. So having said that, I guess I'll begin. If the legislation is available, I'll post it, but not all is so if it's not hyperlinked, that's why.

&#x200B;

Academic Form Act- This establishes a form that students can use to report professors violating university policy or acting in a way that violates the rights of students. The motivation for a reporting forum came from a variety of places, but primarily certain colleges in the Spring telling students that a Pass with a D would not be counted for prerequisites (despite the Provost explicitly stating otherwise) and professors holding classes during the move in days we had a couple of weeks ago (again, in violation of stated University policy). SGA does a great job in my opinion in advocating for the Student Body as a whole, but sometimes individual situations fall between the cracks. This form is meant to address that. This will provide a convenient means for a student to fill out a form and it be passed onto our Academic Affairs committee. It can be either confidential or not, depending on your comfort level as a student. The Academic Affairs committee will then reach out to the professor and/or department chair in order to address and rectify the issue. The Provost has expressed to us that she fully supports this initiative, so we will be operating with her weight behind this, so it is my expectation that this will result in actual corrections, not simply in one ear and out the other. The legislation for this has already passed, but the form itself is still being created and posted to our website. As soon as it is posted, I already know I'll be throwing it on here every chance I get whenever I see students who have legitimate gripes with professors.

&#x200B;

CAPS Funding- This is an ongoing initiative I wanted to share with y'all. CAPS has been struggling for a long time now with a lack of funding, and they haven't received a budget increase in years. Since the last budget increase, we've had the tragic events of April 30th, as well as this pandemic during a semester with no breaks. I sat on the Tuition and Fees Board last year and we actually approved a substantial increase for CAPS funding, which ultimately got shot down at the BOG level as they put a hold on any tuition and fee increases throughout the UNC system due to the negative economic impact of COVID. Understandable of course, but obviously didn't help the CAPS situation. As you can imagine, mental health at UNC Charlotte hasn't been at its peak during this time. Members of Student Government are actively meeting with the University to advocate for an increase in CAPS funding. We're currently working to meet with members of the University's budget office to determine if there are opportunities to shuffle funding around to provide CAPS with an increase. Of course, any increase to CAPS equates to a decrease elsewhere, so that is something we are aware of and will keep in mind as we continue to have these conversations.

&#x200B;

[Indigenous Peoples' Day Act](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lrO2TMbSnPDvJDtWCpNIUqNNETdA8N_s/view)\- This was an initiative brought to us by a fellow student. UNCC had never before acknowledged Indigenous Peoples' Day, despite the city of Charlotte and state of North Carolina previously doing so. UNCC actually sits on land that throughout history has belonged to four different tribes, and as such this student felt it was important for UNC Charlotte to acknowledge and celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day. We worked with administrators and advocated on behalf of this, and as a result, UNC Charlotte recognized Indigenous Peoples' Day for the first time ever this year. 

&#x200B;

[Student Bridge Act](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LubPdxymZocP2LyNdyNxo7ReON8N7NkP/view)\- So this was actually passed over the summer. We had worked with facilities to add a layer of essentially grip tape to the bridge between the Student Union and North Village to prevent slippage. At the time, facilities was in favor of adding this grip tape and it appeared we would move forward with that route. After consulting with engineers, it was determined that adding an adhesive would actually make the situation worse (don't ask me why, I'm a political science and history major because I avoid math and science), however it was determined that the slippage was legit (as virtually any of you who have walked that bridge in the rain can attest to) and it was determined this was because the bridge hadn't been thoroughly scrubbed for a period of time. Since then, the bridge has been scrubbed, so the slippage should no longer be an issue. If you find this ins't the case, please feel free to let me know so that I can follow up and look for alternative solutions.

&#x200B;

I'm going to stop there for now. There's a lot more that we have already completed and continue to work on, and I'm going to provide those updates in the upcoming days. I had the pleasure of serving as 2020 ~~Homecoming~~ Spirit Court Chair, and while I absolutely loved the experience, it unfortunately kept me distracted from providing as many updates on here as I would have liked to. On a personal note, thank you all for the continued opportunity to serve y'all and be your voice. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to let me know and feel free to reach out to me with any initiative ideas or changes that you'd like to see around campus! And shameless plug, regardless of who you're voting for, please be sure to vote if you haven't already.

A rant,"I am only posting here because I feel like I might have some slight influence, and I need to vent about my feelings over the last few months.

The shooting affected me, and many people here emotionally, both directly and indirectly. We are still healing as a community. 

There are people on this subreddit who have been seemingly just attempting to cause discord and hate amongst the community, be it wrongfully attacking and accusing people of being Nazis, be it people calling the university a piece of crap (because they were apparently so bad themselves, that they were denied from other places, and forced to come here), or claiming that nobody cared about the shooting, and that everyone was simply doing it for attention.

First of all, I have to say, fuck you.

I didn’t like UNC Charlotte at first, it wasn’t my first choice, and I was disappointed that I didn’t get into my first pick, so I went with the closest school I could, which was Charlotte, hoping to transfer a few years in.

I applied to transfer to my first choice school, and I got accepted. I was originally planning on transferring, as it has been my dream school for my entire life. 

Then the shooting happened. 
I was incredibly close to the shooting, when it happened, and managed to get away quickly. 

That night I had a panic attack, depression, and nearly killed my self. 

Then, rather quickly, I got a message from every single person who I had given my contact info to at the university, even people who I haven’t even seen in years. Almost every single person contacted me and made sure I was alright, one of them even offered to take me off campus, and back to his family’s house for the night. 

This eliminated any doubt I had about staying at Charlotte, instead of leaving.

Frankly, I don’t care that there are schools that might be better for me educationally in the long run. I don’t care that there is nothing to do uptown, or that the campus is dead on the weekends. I don’t care that some of the university administration is entirely incompetent, and uncaring about the needs of the community. 

This is my home. 

Plus, after some further re-evaluation, Charlotte is probably the best university and city for my major, and my goals in life moving forward.

I am looking forward to the next year, and have come to realize how much of an idiot I was before.

Williams-Tanker Campaign for Student Body President,"Hey all!

As you know, I'm Senator Tanker and alongside my good friend, Madi Williams, I am excited to announce my bid for Student Body Vice President! Madi and I are really excited to step up into this new role to help advocate for the student body.

**What are our qualifications?**

Madi Williams currently serves as the Academic Affairs Secretary in SGA. She has been tirelessly working to encourage the university to use more open-source textbooks, which eliminates financial barriers for low-income students. We are actually the UNC system school with the largest population of low-income students, which is why so many of our platforms are focused on financial equity for students. She also currently serves on a host of committees that work to better the student experience, such as the Faculty Library Advisory Committee, the Student Library Advisory Committee, and the Free Expression and Constructive Dialog Committee.

Sophie Tanker (hey, that’s me!) currently serves as the Parliamentarian in SGA. I’m responsible for understanding and interpreting the bylaws, conducting and recording votes in the Senate, and assisting other Senators with understanding our bylaws. Recently, I’ve been working with the rest of Senate leadership to pass a series of bills to reorganize the Student Senate to work more efficiently. I currently sit on the Internal Affairs Committee, the Legislative Leadership Committee, and the Reorganization Committee.

**What is our platform?**

We have a multitude of platforms that we hope will reach all types of students at Charlotte. Here are a few of our highlights.

*Additional dining times and options*

* Madi and I are no strangers to getting out of a late class and realizing that your options to eat on-campus are either fast food or having sleep for dinner. Currently, SoVi closes at 8:30pm, while Crown closes at 11pm. This is unfair for students living in South Village that just want to get a quick and convenient dinner. We’re looking to expand later dining options on campus for students with later classes, as well as getting more food options for more isolated buildings like Duke, Grigg, and EPIC. 

*Niner alerts including off-campus events*

* The majority of Charlotte students live off campus. When a dangerous crime happens in the University City area, it affects those both on and off campus. We have seen crimes happen at various student living apartments throughout the past year, and we believe it would be best for the Charlotte community to include general University City area happenings in NinerAlerts.

*Better communication between students and HRL*

* Ever since COVID, we have seen the way on-campus housing has changed to fit the new demand of students. As the school discusses implementing a policy to encourage freshman students to stay on campus their first year, we are committed to making sure that current on-campus residents have clear and direct communication from HRL about changes to their living assignments.

*Religious exemption changes*

* This is something that’s close to my heart as a Jewish student. Currently, students have to submit a [religious exemption form](https://legal.charlotte.edu/sites/legal.charlotte.edu/files/media/UP409-ReligiousAccommodationForStudents.pdf) to their professors by the census date of each semester. This is usually 10 days into the semester, and it’s easy to get distracted in the whirlwind of classes starting and forget about this process. We believe that a student should be able to submit this form within 5 class days of their needed exemption.

*Communication to constituents*

* We want to continue to be active on Reddit as well as other social media platforms so we can monitor student concerns. Our goal is to be as accessible as possible.

We are also always looking for suggestions to improve the student experience at Charlotte. If you have any suggestions, feel free to send them to Madi and I on our website, [www.williams-tanker.com](http://www.williams-tanker.com/)! You can also view an extended version of our platform there. We will also be tabling throughout the weeks leading up to the elections, and we look forward to meeting you at some of our events!",1677026333.0,shtanker,"Williams-Tanker Campaign for Student Body President Hey all!

SGA Update 12/10/2021,"Hey everyone,

I hope this finds you well. For those who are unfamiliar with me, I am Joe Morris. I am a Senator who is the Chair of the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y’all on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.

**Campus Lighting-** I had a meeting this week with John Bogdan, Associate Vice Chancellor for Safety and Security at Charlotte (AVC), to discuss concerns I have heard regarding lighting around campus. Before the meeting, I went out at night to gain my own perspective of where I believe the most lighting issues are present. The conclusion I came to was the same as the concerns I had been hearing: campus lighting is overall great, but there are a few lights that do not work, and lighting around Greek Village and the Greenway are not great. When meeting with AVC Bogdan, he informed me that he had been looking into solutions for the Greenway lighting for multiple years, but it is a difficult task considering the Greenway is owned by the City of Charlotte and it would be very expensive to complete. That does not mean the task is impossible though and AVC Bogdan is still looking into increasing the lighting in that area. Greek Village, on the other hand, is owned by the University and would not be quite as costly. AVC Bogdan noted that he had not been in that area in quite some time, but now that he is aware of the issue, he will head over there and determine where new lights need to be placed to increase lighting.

**Car Break Ins-** During my meeting with John Bogdan, I discussed the University’s plan for combating these recent car break ins. If you didn’t know- earlier this week 24 cars were broken into around campus. A total of three items were reported missing, so most of the damage came from broken windows, slashed tires, and other car damages. AVC Bogdan informed me that increasing security to prevent these types of situations has been an ongoing investigation for the past couple of months. Thankfully, the University was just approved by the North Carolina Board of Governors for around one and a half million dollars to increase the number of cameras and security present around campus and specifically in parking lots/decks. While this increased security is being put into place, AVC Bogdan let me know that there is an increased police and direct patrol presence to reduce the possibility of another situation like the one that happened earlier this week. Though security has been and is being improved, it is always a good reminder to lock your car doors and not to leave valuables in your cars.

**COVID-19 and Next Semester-** As you might have heard by now, we had a student test positive for the [Omicron strand of COVID-19](https://emergency.charlotte.edu/communications/ninernotice/latest-ninernotices). This is certainly not expected, but Dick actually connected with AVC Bogdan on Wednesday and they discussed how early studies show that Omicron is more transmissible but we don’t have reason to believe at this time that it is significantly more dangerous. The University is committed to monitoring ongoing changes as they have been throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and will adjust accordingly. As of right now, barring any sort of drastic shift, the University is still committed to a relatively normal spring semester. I spoke to Dick and he anticipates that we will still be in person and we will continue to wear masks indoors as we have been. Just a reminder, the best way we can ensure the preservation of a regular semester is to get the COVID-19 vaccine, any applicable booster shots, and to continue to observe the mask policy. Doing so gives us the best chance to keep Niner Nation safe.

I hope you all had an amazing semester. As this was my first semester in SGA here at Charlotte, I wanted to thank you all again for the amazing opportunity to represent y’all. I am very excited to keep providing SGA updates for many semesters to come. Also, if you noticed in the opening paragraph, I was just recently elected to the Chair of the Publicity and Outreach Committee. I am honored to serve in this position and I will do my best to ensure all students' voices are heard and all students are aware of the work we do in SGA. I wish all of you luck on your finals, Happy Holidays, and have a great rest of your year! If you have any questions/concerns or you just want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out anytime via email at [jmorr151@uncc.edu](mailto:jmorr151@uncc.edu). I can also meet up in person for more prominent issues if necessary, I have a flexible schedule. Go Niners!",1639175111.0,j0emorris,"SGA Update 12/10/2021 Hey everyone,

"Welcome, Future Niners!","To everyone who has recently gained admission to the University, welcome!  While Reddit and this subreddit, in particular, can be discouraging and often times satirical towards those who are seeking admissions advice, know that you will be in good hands at Charlotte.  It is an extremely vibrant and diverse community, and you will have no trouble finding a group that suits you.  

A word of advice to prospective commuters, GET INVOLVED!  College will quickly start to feel like a chore if you only come here for lectures.  Set a goal to do at least one enjoyable thing every day you are at Charlotte, whether that be taking the light rail uptown for lunch with some friends, working out at UREC, or just taking a stroll around campus.  As homework begins to accumulate, you will find these activities incredibly therapeutic.

Finally, Charlotte suffers from the notion of it being a backup school.  While it is true that many students are here because they didn't get into the UNC's and the NC State's of the world, Charlotte affords a plethora of opportunities to those who are willing to work towards them.  The city of Charlotte is one of the nation's fastest-growing cities and companies are investing billions in the region.  No matter your major, chances are that Charlotte has internships and hands-on learning experiences waiting for you.  Being only a stone's throw from the urban core is a massive benefit that often goes overlooked by commuter students.  

College is ultimately what you make of it, as cliche as it sounds.  Charlotte is no exception, and this is especially true for commuter students.  If you were accepted, congrats!  If not, know that there are many paths to Charlotte.

Go Niners!",1635225797.0,MrWashy-Washy,"Welcome, Future Niners! To everyone who has recently gained admission to the University, welcome!  While Reddit and this subreddit, in particular, can be discouraging and often times satirical towards those who are seeking admissions advice, know that you will be in good hands at Charlotte.  It is an extremely vibrant and diverse community, and you will have no trouble finding a group that suits you.  

A word of advice to prospective commuters, GET INVOLVED!  College will quickly start to feel like a chore if you only come here for lectures.  Set a goal to do at least one enjoyable thing every day you are at Charlotte, whether that be taking the light rail uptown for lunch with some friends, working out at UREC, or just taking a stroll around campus.  As homework begins to accumulate, you will find these activities incredibly therapeutic.

Finally, Charlotte suffers from the notion of it being a backup school.  While it is true that many students are here because they didn't get into the UNC's and the NC State's of the world, Charlotte affords a plethora of opportunities to those who are willing to work towards them.  The city of Charlotte is one of the nation's fastest-growing cities and companies are investing billions in the region.  No matter your major, chances are that Charlotte has internships and hands-on learning experiences waiting for you.  Being only a stone's throw from the urban core is a massive benefit that often goes overlooked by commuter students.

BE CAREFUL W/ OFF-CAMPUS HOUSING!,"I feel like this needs to be said because I am seeing too many people having issues with these places. I am gonna tell everyone this who doesn't know already about the off-campus apartments around UNCC.

1) These apartments do not have cameras and are not liable if anything happens to your vehicle. They don't care about you and never will. UNCC is known to have a lot of auto crimes, especially inside the apartment complexes since these criminals know no one is watching and there aren't any cameras. Even on-campus, in some spots there aren't any cameras so please be prepared parking anywhere on campus to install some sort of protection or park in crowded areas.

2) Due to inflation and the # of students coming to UNCC. Prices are going UP UP. Just know that now your going to be paying just less if you plan to live off-campus than on-campus. Also, the quality you get to live on campus is so much more better than living off campus. You can also cancel in between semesters so your not stuck with a lease for an entire year. On-campus is looking like a more attractive purchase, so don't get fooled by the off-campus price tags. It's still expensive and they will scam you in some place or form.

3) You need to talk to someone before moving in honestly. These apartment complexes will scam you by showing you a super clean room and that it would look like that when you move in. Lies! Most of them put minimum effort into making sure your apartment is liveable and anything before your previous tenant might still be in your apartment when you move in. Do your research and don't settle for less. Your paying for it after all.

4) Finally, the off-campus lifestyle is honestly non existent. If you move in with friends, that's different. If you move in with random roommates. It's honesty a gamble if your gonna make friends with them. Most of the apartment complexes will put someone who shows they are clean, never smokes, or never bring anyone over. But that person in real life does not clean up after themselves, will smoke weed, and bring their friends over all time. Be careful signing up because you will never know the type of roommate you will get.

Overall, diss me if you want but I have had so many issues with these apartment complexes that I would hate for someone else to come in and experience the same issues I had. If you have the option to live with your parents or live on-campus. DO IT! If off-campus is your only option, try to look for something a little farther away from University boulevard as all of the apartment complexes right next to uncc fit the criteria I just said above.

potentially new to town,"hello everyone!

I recently applied for a job at the university and I wanted to be ahead of the curve on things like housing, night life, vibe of campus, etc,.

a little background on me & this gig: I’d be working within the athletics department focusing on broadcasting 49er’s athletic events. I just graduated from college (Ohio University!), I’m 23, single & still pretty close in age to the demographic a university environment brings. I’d be moving from Cleveland to Charlotte. 

I currently can afford a 1b,1b apartment for under $1k in rent. I wouldn’t say it’s a massive place but it’s enough for just me to live with. Is there something in this range(ish) that isn’t student housing? I also live outside of the downtown area and if it’s cheaper in a suburb I’m okay with a commute into work every day. 

Second, do y’all support your college athletic teams? With so many pro sports in town, I would find it hard for the university to compete. I know the university is in G5 conference (Conference USA), and this is similar to the conference I began my career in (MAC). Is there decent football? Do you guys tailgate? What’s the morale behind being a Niner? 

Third, are you guys a commuter school considering it’s in the city? In Cleveland, a majority of the schools up here are considered backpack campuses, meaning everyone goes home on the weekends because they’re locals. 

Fourth, night life? Is downtown your playground? Or are there local bars campus favors because they’re cheaper, etc,.? Where I went to school, we had 24 bars in the span of a 1.5 miles. That’s it. So every night out was bar hopping, cause they were all next door to each other. 

I’ve been in town before and I absolutely love the area. It’s gorgeous and I have family just over the border in Fort Sill. 

thanks so much in advance & hopefully go niners! 💚

Student Government Update,"Hey guys, it’s Dick again. As always, I’m speaking on my behalf alone, not that of Student Government or the University. I wanted to provide you with some updates. 

As mentioned in another thread, Student Government voted on Tuesday to authorize a referendum regarding the proposed Fall 2020 schedule. This referendum will be sent out to the student body on May 25th. As one of the authors of the referendum, I can tell you that it’ll lay out in a neutral fashion the positives and negatives of each proposal (the one advocated for by Student Government and the one approved by the school) and asks you to give an informed decision on whether you are for, against, or neutral towards each proposal. Obviously, I’m biased towards the proposal I authored, but I would encourage you to review the pros and cons of each one and make an informed vote. It is important to note that this is for data collecting purposes only, and does not mean that the school will necessarily go with one proposal over another based off of the results. 

The Faculty Council met today (imagine Student Government, but for professors). I would note that when asked which proposal the faculty would support, they indicated to the Provost they would prefer Student Government’s proposal which calls for an August 24th start to the school year in an online capacity, with a transition to in person classes on September 7th, or when deemed safe by public health officials, allowing for the preservation of breaks. 

I have had a number of students send me the proposals NC State and UNC are moving forward with. A common question has been “why can’t we do this?”  It’s a great question, and let me explain some of the legitimate concerns that I share with the school regarding an early start to the school year thay has us out by Thanksgiving Break. Per the Provost and the Chancellor, the city of Charlotte currently has a projected peak for COVID-19 of late July. On top of this, we also have the RNC coming to town late August, and there’s no telling what that will do for the COVID-19 situation in Charlotte, though it’s hard to imagine any scenario in which that makes it better. Because of this, the school believes it to be in the best interests of all that if there are to be any changes with the school’s start date that it should be pushed back, not up as seen by their proposal. I personally agree with the schools logic here, though I would continue to advocate that a normal, online start to the school year still addresses these concerns while protecting student’s breaks. There have been discussions with the school about the possibility of making classes entirely online following Thanksgiving Break so as to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases as students return from home. This is still a developing conversation, and I will keep you updated as I hear more. 

As always, thank you for your patience as I type out my essay of an update. Your continued support as we continue to navigate this difficult out situation is appreciated as always, and if you have any specific questions, comments, concerns, etc. I would invite you to message me personally so that I may help you with them.

Hurricane Dorian is heading our way now. If it comes near (and that’s a big if) here’s what that could mean for us.,"#Note: I don’t work for the University and I am not speaking on their behalf. These are my expectations based on previous experience.

Since everyone loves stormchasing, I figured I’d throw this together.

The storm, originally bound for Florida, has shifted towards the Carolinas with the biggest hit to SC:

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hurricane-dorian-strengthens-shifts-towards-carolinas-florida-forecast-avoid-direct-n1048601

So, what does that mean for us, Charlotte students? A few things.

You can probably expect an uptick in NinerAlerts, mostly. As we all know, most class decisions are made based on the weather on campus as compared to the city as a whole (at least officially) so it would probably be Tuesday or Wednesday before any official decisions are released (if needed.)

If the school cancels classes, a lot of times they will give professors the option to hold an online class, or require them to reschedule. That usually only happens if we miss a bunch of days and are out of that built-in buffer that the school usually creates for itself. Either way, don’t be suprised if you still have some work to do even if you’re getting some days off.

The storm won’t be a Hurricane when it comes to Charlotte, **if it comes to Charlotte at all.** We’re still a few days out from *really* knowing where the storm is going. Charlotte has only gotten one actual hurricane in the last 100 years. We won’t die, likely. But a tropical storm coasting our way absolutely can knock out power and make it totally unsafe to drive. 

Here’s a prediction, if it continues on its current path: **“The Charlotte area could see tropical storm force winds of 39 mph to 73 mph arrive by about 8 p.m. Tuesday, according to hurricane center maps of the storm.”** Source: https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/weather-news/article234591767.html

So, you know, no matter what the school decides to do, don’t risk your safety trying to pull up to class. **That being said don’t make your decision on coming or not based on me. I wouldn’t want your grades to be effected because of me.** Be safe, know the situation around you, and inform your professors if it is unsafe to come to campus. “Turn around, don’t drown, your car is not a boat...”

Is it worth it?,"Hello from Washington State.

I’m currently a Community College student here in Tacoma looking to transfer to UNCC for Computer Science (UwSeattle don’t want me 😪)  3.8 GPA 

Don’t get me wrong, i love the west coast but I’ve been in Washington all my life and I really wanna go to UNCC because I heard it has the best Computer Science program in the state but I’m just wondering is it really worth paying out-of-State tuition? I have some family who lives in NC so could i stay with them like 3 months then qualify for in-state or am I️ tripping? 

I’ve been accepted to WSU(Washington state University) Gonzaga and Eastern Washington University but by the time i pay Gonzaga’s in state tuition ($43,000+) i might as well kms:)


Also what are the odds of getting a transfer scholarship if UNCC offers them? 

And if i stay a year could i qualify for in state the following year? 

Go niners! (I hope)

Voter turnout among 18-29 yrs of age,"Here are some data on voter turnout in the 18-29 year old age group.  In North Carolina, voter turnout among ""youth"" is almost equal to the total number of young voters in 2016.

All political parties are watching to see how much influence your college-age peers will have in the election.   They may change to favor issues that YOU care more about when voter turnout is high.  Will they support college tuition support or increased retirement funds for 60 yr olds?   Part of their decision will depend on who is voting.

So if you haven't already, **please VOTE today**.  Polls are open in North Carolina Nov. 3 until 7:30pm.  If you are in line by then, they cannot legally turn you away.  Hold your place in line and exercise your constitutional right to be heard.  Make sure to look at your choices in state and local races.  For some parts of our lives the City of Charlotte or State Senate may have even greater influence.

PS- The state government appointed the University System Board of Governors, which made decisions about tuition, fees, and COVID-19 policies.  You want to vote because they influence your life directly.

My name is Jeremy Yagoda and I’m running for SGA underclassman senate! Voting ends today at 5pm!,"This last year, we students were forced to experience one of the most overwhelming and confusing times we may have to live through. The university didn’t believe it was necessary to keep us in the loop and was not understanding after making impulsive decisions that drastically changed our everyday lives. As SGA underclassman senator, I will make sure that the university has a plan in place in case anything like this is to continue or happen again, and we aren’t left to fend for ourselves. Secondly, the school’s inability to provide meals to students in a timely manner is unacceptable. I would like to explore the possibilities that the campus may implement to help in cutting wait times for food, such as bringing back to-go meals from Crown and SoVi. As our campus continues to grow, so do the many backgrounds and ethnicities of our student body. Creating a day for local food trucks to provide authentic meals would be a great way to showcase the identities of our campus. Lastly, I want to utilize the vast amount of open spaces the campus has to offer for frequent entertainment and exciting activities including yoga and tailgating at no cost for all of us to take a break after a long day. I also have noticed how helpful it is to have our student body president, Dick Beekman, to post updates to this page. I would like to do the same about everything happening on campus, and expand SGA’s social media presence to provide more frequent updates. 

Since 6th grade, I’ve known my goal in life is to create effective change and since have tried to do anything I can to stand up to injustice and develop my leadership skills. I am currency the vice president of Kappa Alpha Order, a new fraternity on campus, that I have had the pleasure to help build from the ground up. As well as VP, I am the chairmen of the brotherhood committee, new member education, and formally diversity and inclusion. While I was in high school, I was chosen by the American Legion to be a part of New York’s unique Boys’ State, run by the U.S. Marines, training us to become professional leaders. I also placed 2nd in a business partnership state competition for Future Bussiness leaders of America, qualifying for the national competition. My school lacked any political club, so I started our first Model United Nations club, taking us to two conferences. Additionally, as a senior, I led a movement against my school board, to prevent the termination of our principal, during which I had to speak in front of my city officials, school board, the media, and our entire city. When speaking out didn’t work, I was willing to escalate my cause, and started sit-in protests and marches, resulting in the resignation of our superintendent. Just as I wasn’t afraid of speaking out against them, I won’t be afraid to call out the school when they do something they shouldn’t, as well as help find solutions to fix the problem.

Campus Construction - Simple rant,"There is a lot of construction happening on campus right now. Quite a few trees are being torn down along the Greenway beside the track field, tennis courts and alumni pavilion. A large path all the way down the Greenway has also been completely cleared out. I understand the mission here is to mitigate the flooding issue (and upgrade the sewage system). 

What I don't understand is where all these animals were supposed to go that lived in and around the trees. Last year I had one hawk living close to my apartment and I would see them every week or so. I now have at least 3 hawks, and there are multiple living along Mary Alexander Road, including in the trees at the botanical gardens. 

I feel for them. I hope they can survive. I'm sure they don't have enough food here. 

Does anyone know how Charlotte's Canopy City rules work? The trees there were so dense, and full of life.

SGA Update 9/7,"Hey Y'all,

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I hope everyone had an enjoyable weekend, especially after that phenomenal Friday night win against Duke. I wanted to come on here and share some updates regarding some big picture issues facing the campus, and speak as to what we're doing to look out for you.

I mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/pcd80k/sga_dining_services_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) some first steps we were taking to help alleviate the problem. Unfortunately, the issues surrounding on campus dining remain. My Secretary for Business Services, Ross Landgraf, is meeting with Dining Services with an intent to push for more to be done regarding the situation. Some, but not all, of the recommendations we're looking to implement include expanding the to go option for Crown beyond simply when they're at maximum capacity, bringing in food trucks to help alleviate the strain on dining establishments, and prioritizing hiring at either Crown or Sovi so that at least one dining hall can expand their hours to provide more times for students to eat. Behind only COVID-19, this has been the most pressing issue on campus in my opinion. I've spoken with a number of y'all over the past couple of weeks and heard firsthand the struggles you're facing. As a student myself, I'm facing the same struggles, and wanted to assure you that this issue isn't being simply written off. While it is true that every year we experience longer waits at the beginning of the semester, I don't know that we've ever experienced a situation this bad. I do also want to emphasize that dining services truly is working tirelessly alongside of us to come up with a solution. Just the other day, I found Sarah Lynch, the Resident District Manager for Chartwells, up to her elbows washing out blenders at Shake Smart. I say this to illustrate that all of dining services truly understands the severity of the issue, and we are all working to find a solution that works. Patience is hard in this situation, and by no means am I saying your frustrations are invalid. I would give a shameless plug that the issue at hand is not the result of the individuals behind the counter. Quite the opposite, they are working hard towards being the solution.

**COVID-19-** COVID-19 continues to be constantly monitored and discussed on truly a daily, if not hourly basis. As many of y'all may be aware, last week we had our second COVID cluster identified. I said it then, and I want to reiterate it again now: COVID clusters are going to happen this semester. Our goal is not the elimination of risk entirely, it is the mitigation of risk as much as possible. Were we trying to completely eliminate risk, the answer would be simple. We would be online, back home, with no in-person events. That is not the goal here. The goal is to have an in-person semester as safely as possible. That means we're going to have to take some steps back to preserve our semester. That means wearing masks indoors, complying with testing protocols, not going to class if you feel sick, getting the COVID-19 vaccine, and more. Even outdoors, when in large crowds, I would encourage all students to wear their masks to help slow the spread. We are not out of the woods yet with this pandemic. Far from it. The latest date that was thrown out to me was the week of September 26th for the peak. That means we still have some ways to go. As we get closer to the projected peak, as the situation continues to change, we will adjust accordingly. That doesn't mean we're about to move online, that doesn't mean the situation is deteriorating beyond the point of control. It simply means we're being proactive in mitigating this pandemic. I understand the fears, and your concerns are absolutely valid. But I wanted to throw this out there to help alleviate any fears that we may be on the brink of shifting everything online. We are not, and if we get to that point, I will let y'all know.

**Athletics-** On to a happier topic! Unless you've been living under a rock, we beat Duke on Friday! This was a huge win for our program, and if you're reading this with any ties to the football team, thank you for all the hard work you've done to make this moment a reality. I briefly spoke with Chancellor Gaber the day following the win, and emphasized to her that for the first time in 19 months, I saw our student body genuinely happy and care free. That meant a lot to me, and I know it means even more to y'all. I did want to give a friendly plug for our other sports as well. Women's volleyball just won the Windy City Classic in Chicago, women's soccer has been absolutely fire at home this season, and men's soccer just had a huge come from behind last minute win against Seattle to move to 2-1 for the season. We have a great sports program here at Charlotte, and while we absolutely need to keep this energy level up in football, let's keep it up for our other sports as well.

**“HEY JEFF - YOU KNOW WE CAN’T STAY HOME FOREVER, RIGHT?”**

Let’s talk about how North Carolina gets back to work.

And let’s skip the obvious stuff - like hand-washing and staying home if we’re sick.

To fully reopen, we’re going to need to know four things: Who’s sick, who’s not, who’s been sick, and who hasn’t.

(You don’t need multiple studies to know that, but if you want here are three: [1](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2020/04/03/482613/national-state-plan-end-coronavirus-crisis/), [2](https://ethics.harvard.edu/test-millions), [3](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/).)

That’s the information that will let us track and control future localized outbreaks (which are inevitable) without requiring wide-scale shutdowns.

It will also give the public confidence that it’s safe to become customers - not just employees - of restaurants, theaters, barber shops, airlines, hotels, sports arenas, food trucks, colleges and universities.

Having this information early is how South Korea was able to demolish the infection curve and reopen society much faster than any other country. And the way they got there was early, widespread testing - followed by aggressive contact tracing and isolation.

We missed the opportunity to get ahold of this on the front-end because we didn’t have that kind of widespread testing, and we didn’t have it for three reasons: a lack of test kits, a lack of related chemicals needed to use the test kits, and a lack of PPE needed to administer the tests.

But we can’t just call that a failure a move on. We actually have to solve the problem, only now it’s much bigger because the universe of those who are potentially infected has grown by several orders of magnitude.

One more factor: The testing can’t just be widespread - it also has to be rapid. Waiting ten days for a result isn’t particularly helpful when that person can easily infect dozens more while results are pending.

So let’s take a close look at what it will actually take to get rapid, widespread testing in North Carolina.

**MOLECULAR TESTING**

Broadly speaking, there are two types of tests: molecular and antibody.

The molecular tests are the ones we’ve been using. You take a swab from the back of someone’s nose or throat, you extract the RNA, then you see if it matches the COVID RNA.

We’ve done about 48,000 so far in North Carolina (that number includes private labs, which are currently doing the vast majority of the testing). We did about 5,000 yesterday.

https://preview.redd.it/vz6ivbl7k8s41.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4583bf6795973eb82f5b581995fa1942c51e833

Molecular tests are highly accurate, but the global demand for them is so high that we’ve been plagued by a number of material shortages needed to perform them. The biggest shortage right now is the PPE needed to administer the test.

Our state has received three shipments from the National Strategic Stockpile totaling roughly 33% of our requested supply. Now the stockpile is nearly depleted and we’ve been told there will not be another shipment. In search for more, our state emergency management agency has submitted $125 million worth of bids on PPE to private manufacturers across the country but only a small fraction of those bids has been accepted. As has been widely reported, we are competing against other states and other hospital systems, and the competition is fierce. In better news, we have several manufacturers in North Carolina which have switched production to PPE for use by our front-line workers, so we hope that will help meet a growing share of the need.

That brings us to the molecular test kits (and related chemical supplies) themselves. We’ve seen a dramatic increase in private lab testing capacity in the last few weeks. But we’ve also seen real innovation. Most prominently, Abbott Labs now has a machine which will give a result in 15 minutes. It got FDA approval about ten days ago and is now probably the most in-demand medical device on earth.

Abbott says they can only make 400 of these machines per week for the foreseeable future. The federal government is in charge of allocating them to states. So far, most states - like North Carolina - have received 15 machines.

Let’s do some quick math. Over the next six weeks, Abbott should be able to make 2,400 of these machines. North Carolina has roughly 3% of the national population, so let’s say we get 3% of the machines (big assumption). That means we might get another 70 machines within the next six weeks, for a total of 85 machines. 85 machines working 24/7 at a rate of roughly 4 tests per hour = roughly 8,000 tests per day.

We tested 5,000 yesterday, so that would be a big jump for us. Even those assumptions are off by 25%, it would still double our current testing capacity. So getting more Abbott machines won't be the whole solution for us, but it’ll be a big piece.

And don't forget that other companies are also entering the space of rapid molecular testing. Just as no one was talking about the Abbott machine two weeks ago, the pace of innovation is such that two weeks from now we may have a new device to complement our Abbott machines.

Overall, it is very realistic to expect our state’s molecular testing capacity to grow significantly this month. HOWEVER, it may not be realistic to expect the kind of 10x growth in testing capacity which some say will be necessary to reopen without resurging the virus.

Which brings us to antibodies.

**ANTIBODY TESTING**

This is more controversial, in part because it started as an overly optimistic theory that tried to downplay the need for a strong response to the coronavirus.

The theory was this: What if it turns out that a massive share of the population has unknowingly been infected already, and has since recovered, and therefore we really don’t need to worry so much and we can go about our daily lives?

Ok… so how would you test that theory?

Here’s how: You would do widespread, random testing of the population to screen for antibodies that would indicate whether the virus had already been there and had been successfully fought off.

But in European cities that have been hit reasonably hard by COVID, random antibody testing hasn’t shown the type of widespread infection the theory posed - which frankly makes sense, given how new the virus itself is.

But there remains a case to make for the widespread use of antibody testing. Different companies report different rates of accuracy, but most report that their antibody tests can detect COVID over 90% of the time. The tests are at the lower end of the accuracy range in the early days of infection, before the body has had time to build up enough antibodies to register with the test. But any COVID test with an accuracy rate above 90% - *when the alternative may be no test at all* \- has to be seriously considered.

And while there is probably no chance that widespread, asymptomatic infection has already occurred, antibody testing at random across the state - or in certain vulnerable communities - might be helpful in identifying hot spots and letting us know where to focus our supply of molecular tests.

A notable concern is that antibody tests are more likely to error on the side of a false negative than a false positive. A false negative is worse, from a public health standpoint, than a false positive. The last thing we want is to tell someone they’re not infected and send them back into public only to find out later that they really were infected. Minimizing the risk of false negatives with antibody tests is an important piece of adopting them into regular use. (Note: A similar concern of false negatives also pertains to the Abbott test.)

The antibody test itself is very simple. It works by doing a finger prick and getting a blood sample. And you get the results in minutes.

Currently the FDA only recommends the use of antibody tests for broader screening purposes to determine who has already had COVID, but there’s an ongoing conversation about whether the test can also be accurate enough to also be used for diagnostic purposes - that is, to see if someone with symptoms is currently infected.

So let’s say we wanted to incorporate some form of widespread antibody testing into our state’s tool kit for virus detection. Now the question becomes, do we face the same shortages that we currently face with the molecular tests?

Right now, there are only a few companies which have FDA authorization to distribute antibody tests. These tests are not yet available in the tens of millions, which is what you would need to create a national supply from which North Carolina would stand to receive an amount big enough to make a dent. But things are evolving rapidly and there’s renewed interest in antibody testing at the national level so this situation could be very different in ten days. Yesterday, Dr. Fauci said, ""Within a period of a week or so, we're going to have a rather large number of \[antibody\] tests that are available.” He suggested that these antibody tests would be used in addition to the molecular tests.

**HOW MANY DAILY TESTS DO WE NEED TO PREVENT A RESURGENCE?**

No one knows. Estimates vary wildly. But certainly multiples of what we’re doing now.

Here are three pieces of good news to end on:

1. There’s a particular advantage to not being the first state to have a major outbreak. Several states - including New York, California, and Washington - are going to hit peak infection before we do. That means they’re going to be the first to experiment with how to reopen. They're going to be the first to decide how many tests, what kinds of tests, how to stagger the return to work, how to conduct effective monitoring, when to reopen schools. That means we'll have the opportunity to observe and learn some best practices before we’re in the same position. That's a big advantage for us - it's also a reason why you're not going to see a fully formed Grand Plan for reopening yet. We're not done learning from the experience of other states.
2. We know it’s going to be a heavy lift to get to the testing capacity we’re going to need in order to fully reopen, but the purpose of this post was to show you that there is a roadmap for getting there. Ramping up testing capacity doesn’t involve just pulling one lever - we have to do several different things simultaneously. But we've got a sense of what those things are and we're being realistic about what it's going to take.
3. **Most important:** There is a set of overwhelming incentives on the part of virtually everyone - state officials, politicians, business leaders, students, parents, workers - to reopen without causing a resurgence. Everyone is working toward the same goal. When that happens in our country - and it’s very, very rare - we tend to accomplish much more than we thought we could at the start.

**ANTIBODY TESTING**

This is more controversial, in part because it started as an overly optimistic theory that tried to downplay the need for a strong response to the coronavirus.

The theory was this: What if it turns out that a massive share of the population has unknowingly been infected already, and has since recovered, and therefore we really don’t need to worry so much and we can go about our daily lives?

Ok… so how would you test that theory?

Here’s how: You would do widespread, random testing of the population to screen for antibodies that would indicate whether the virus had already been there and had been successfully fought off.

But in European cities that have been hit reasonably hard by COVID, random antibody testing hasn’t shown the type of widespread infection the theory posed - which frankly makes sense, given how new the virus itself is.

But there remains a case to make for the widespread use of antibody testing. Different companies report different rates of accuracy, but most report that their antibody tests can detect COVID over 90% of the time. The tests are at the lower end of the accuracy range in the early days of infection, before the body has had time to build up enough antibodies to register with the test. But any COVID test with an accuracy rate above 90% - *when the alternative may be no test at all* \- has to be seriously considered.

And while there is probably no chance that widespread, asymptomatic infection has already occurred, antibody testing at random across the state - or in certain vulnerable communities - might be helpful in identifying hot spots and letting us know where to focus our supply of molecular tests.

A notable concern is that antibody tests are more likely to error on the side of a false negative than a false positive. A false negative is worse, from a public health standpoint, than a false positive. The last thing we want is to tell someone they’re not infected and send them back into public only to find out later that they really were infected. Minimizing the risk of false negatives with antibody tests is an important piece of adopting them into regular use. (Note: A similar concern of false negatives also pertains to the Abbott test.)

The antibody test itself is very simple. It works by doing a finger prick and getting a blood sample. And you get the results in minutes.

Currently the FDA only recommends the use of antibody tests for broader screening purposes to determine who has already had COVID, but there’s an ongoing conversation about whether the test can also be accurate enough to also be used for diagnostic purposes - that is, to see if someone with symptoms is currently infected.

So let’s say we wanted to incorporate some form of widespread antibody testing into our state’s tool kit for virus detection. Now the question becomes, do we face the same shortages that we currently face with the molecular tests?

Right now, there are only a few companies which have FDA authorization to distribute antibody tests. These tests are not yet available in the tens of millions, which is what you would need to create a national supply from which North Carolina would stand to receive an amount big enough to make a dent. But things are evolving rapidly and there’s renewed interest in antibody testing at the national level so this situation could be very different in ten days. Yesterday, Dr. Fauci said, ""Within a period of a week or so, we're going to have a rather large number of \[antibody\] tests that are available.” He suggested that these antibody tests would be used in addition to the molecular tests.

**HOW MANY DAILY TESTS DO WE NEED TO PREVENT A RESURGENCE?**

No one knows. Estimates vary wildly. But certainly multiples of what we’re doing now.

Here are three pieces of good news to end on:

1. There’s a particular advantage to not being the first state to have a major outbreak. Several states - including New York, California, and Washington - are going to hit peak infection before we do. That means they’re going to be the first to experiment with how to reopen. They're going to be the first to decide how many tests, what kinds of tests, how to stagger the return to work, how to conduct effective monitoring, when to reopen schools. That means we'll have the opportunity to observe and learn some best practices before we’re in the same position. That's a big advantage for us - it's also a reason why you're not going to see a fully formed Grand Plan for reopening yet. We're not done learning from the experience of other states.
2. We know it’s going to be a heavy lift to get to the testing capacity we’re going to need in order to fully reopen, but the purpose of this post was to show you that there is a roadmap for getting there. Ramping up testing capacity doesn’t involve just pulling one lever - we have to do several different things simultaneously. But we've got a sense of what those things are and we're being realistic about what it's going to take.
3. **Most important:** There is a set of overwhelming incentives on the part of virtually everyone - state officials, politicians, business leaders, students, parents, workers - to reopen without causing a resurgence. Everyone is working toward the same goal. When that happens in our country - and it’s very, very rare - we tend to accomplish much more than we thought we could at the start.

What is Charlotte missing to elevate it to a tier 1 city?,"I've lived in Charlotte for 6 years now and I've heard many criticisms from the other locals, elders in the community, and chatter around Applebee's. They're common themes that can be put into two buckets. 

bucket 1: why isn't Charlotte a Tier 1 city? 

bucket 2: why is the traffic so bad?

These problems can be quickly solved in two ways. 1. Get a remote job, 2. Charlotte should redirect the Catawba River to flow through uptown. Option 1 is pretty attainable outside of a University of Phoenix degree or any UNCC graduate degree but would result in much of the skilled workforce to leave, sell their car and move to a walkable tier 1 city like NYC, London or Bangkok. It begs the question how can we turn Charlotte into a tier 1 city AND solve the traffic for those unable to work remote?

This is where solution 2 comes in, redirect the Catawba river through uptown. London, Paris, NYC, Bangkok, Tokyo, Beijing and New Orleans all have a river that flows through them. Chicago takes this a step further and even dies it green to remind everyone that the river does go through the city. Charlotte does not have this, if you want any river action in this city you need to go to the white water center which sucks on game day because its so far. I would propose that river be moved through uptown where water taxis could be used and cars would no longer be needed. Waste pick-up would no longer be needed because any waste would be redirected to the water. The new uptown would offer new transportation, waters edge entertainment, and tax dollars saved from no longer needing city waste pick up.

70K Salary enough in Charlotte?,"Hi everyone, I’ll be moving to charlotte later on this year with my gf for work. Does 70K is enough for two people? I come from a small town in Texas in which 70K will last for a full family of 5 or 6.

I know Charlotte is a bigger city, more expensive, etc. But is 70K enough to live comfortable?  How expensive is rent? I will be working in uptown and everything seems to be around $1500 monthly for a 1 bedroom apt.

Any tips will be helpful, visited Charlotte last year and I LOVED the city!!!! 

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the help, my gf is looking for a job, we don’t plan to live of my salary forever, hopefully within the next months she gets a job and we should be good having two incomes instead of one.
Also thanks for recommending i should look for something further from uptown to save on rent! Should i look into south end, near university or which area?
I don’t have car payments or debts at the moment, my job provides health insurance, my phone bill is around 40 dollars a month and I don’t have a crazy lifestyle, Im very down to earth and go out rarely, but I do enjoy going out to explore parks, etc.

A 2-Year Transplants Take on Charlotte,"After living in Dilworth for two years now I thought I’d share my general thoughts on Charlotte for those considering or recently moved to the area, and respond to some of the frequent comments here.

1.	Charlotte overall is really nice — I’ve lived in London, Chicago, NYC, and Minneapolis and Charlotte has been my favorite for raising a family — would not be my favorite as a single early 20s (NYC/London for sure)
2.	There is a ton to do in the area… see a lot of comments suggesting otherwise but I don’t think people fully appreciate how many day trip options there are… nature (Lake James, Appalachians, Pisgah and a million other options), beach towns, cool day trip cities like Greenville and Asheville, big cities like ATL… people say “oh great the best thing to do is leave Charlotte” but if you live somewhere like MPLS with nothing really nearby you will come to appreciate all that the area has to offer.
3.	There is a ton to do in Charlotte itself; it is definitely NOT a great tourist town but having lived in those… the tourist stuff is a once a year thing anyway. It would be nice if there were more city festivals unique to Charlotte like Holidazzle in MPLS or Christkindlemart in Chicago — I’m working with a few local groups on ideas would love suggestions. 
4.	In the summer getting up to the mountains offers sweet relief, it’s like 20 degrees cooler and camping under the stars is beautiful. Also paddle boarding or kayaking lake Norman and going for a swim (people on here say it’s toxic but my friends and I have swam in LKN and Wylie 100+ times and never gotten sick so…)
5.	Be the change you seek — if you want more culture, what local groups are you joining to start festivals or get new murals or support diverse restaurants etc.? Trust me being involved will make you feel part of the city very quickly. 
6.	The greenway system here is going to be world class in a few years. Yesterday I biked the cross Charlotte trail from freedom park to South Carolina with zero road crossings that is pretty unique and was beautiful to ride. Once it extends all the way through the city to university? Amazing.
7.	There are very walkable neighborhoods but they come at a premium; but anyone who says that there are no old charming places have not walked dilworth or Elizabeth or plaza. 
8.	Our airport is amazing and close to the city but flights are annoyingly expensive which is a PITA. Tough with the American dominance.
9.	The climate here is honestly the best of the cities listed above… especially if you take advantage of the mountains and beach in the summer. From oct-May I’d put the Charlotte climate up against any other US city outside of CA. 
10. There are a lot of bankers here but also a lot of non bankers (we have Lowes, duke, nucor, honeywell… big consulting presence and hospital network)… people who complain about ‘banker bros’ would also complain about ‘tech bros’ in San Fran or ‘hill bros’ in DC so take that with a grain of salt plenty of cool bankers out there.
11. South end is really nice… sure there’s  lot of young beautiful people but also a lot of old dudes like me with their families.

What's On The Ballot: Charlotte Municipal Election Happening Now,"&#x200B;

The election is Nov 7 and early voting is now.  You’re voting for city council (4 at large seats) and board of election (3 at large seats).  The only contested district races in the council are 3 and 6.  I reached out to all the candidates except the mayoral ones.  If they wrote me back, I gave them an A for accessibility and responsiveness. If there's no grade, there was no response. Please vote and share this information with the voters you know!  Here are the candidates:

**Mayor of Charlotte**

**Vi Lyles.** Lyles is running for her fourth term as mayor. She is the first Black woman to be mayor of Charlotte. She won 77% and 68% of the vote respectively in the last two elections. In a [WSOC interview](https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/political-beat-candidate-guide-city-charlotte-sept-2023-primaries/VSYJOBWM2JBKVANAW472GS7K2I/), she said her priority is “creating safe and livable neighborhoods that provide opportunities for employment and efficient transportation to and from those jobs.” She has worked in city government for years, including as a city council member and as mayor pro tem. She generally has a strong reputation in Charlotte. She has supported city improvement bonds, an expanded light rail, and job growth. Lyles has her bachelor’s degree from Queens University and an MPA from UNC Chapel Hill. (Age 71, Incumbent, Democrat, Black)

**Misun Kim**. Kim is a local entrepreneur and immigrant from Korea. In [an interview with the Charlotte Ledger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCmmb7FQm8o), she says she is running to “give back” for all the education and good fortune that the US gave her. She feels that Lyles has been in office for 3 terms which is “too long” and that a fresh set of eyes is needed. She says that if elected she will “reanalyze the budget” and pick contractors to save the city money. She says she also wants to bring high-tech companies to Charlotte. She says, “It’s time for Charlotte to be a rich city.” She has no prior experience serving in public office and this appears to be her first time running for a role. (\~Age 61, Republican, Asian)

**Rob Yates.** Yates has lived in Charlotte for more than 14 years and is running because he believes that [Charlotte has succumbed to “the worst perils of city government.” ](https://www.lpnc.org/yates) He cites the CMS clear backpack fiasco and says the board was “playing hungry-hungry-hippos to pick superintendents” (though he recognizes that the Board of Education operates independently from the Mayor).  He also cites problems with high housing prices and crime. On his website, he mentions affordable housing, the need to reduce waste in public transportation, public safety and upward mobility as the biggest problems facing Charlotte. He says he believes in the libertarian ideals of [“don’t hurt people and don’t take their stuff.”](https://prospercharlotte2023.com/about) He is a graduate of George Mason University and has an MBA from Wake Forest. Yates is involved with the non-profits the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. He does not have prior experience in public office. (Approx age early 40s, Libertarian, White)

**At-Large Council Candidates (vote for up to 4)**

**Dimple Ajmera.** Ajmera has served on the city council since 2017 and received the highest number of votes in the last 2 council elections (September 2023 and July 2022).

On her website she says that she is “a voice for Charlotte’s most vulnerable residents.” She thinks that Ballantyne for instance should offer more affordable housing. While she opposed the UDO, she evidently was [not present during the meeting](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/development/article264764564.html) for the vote.

He voted against the August 2022 UDO.

He says he is [affiliated with the conservative group Moms for Liberty](https://www.wfae.org/2023-09-11/charlotte-mecklenburg-schools-board) though that group said they did not endorse any candidates. Accessibility and responsiveness: A.  (Age 80, Republican, White)

(Age 51, Democrat, Black). 

**Lenora Shipp.** Shipp [was a former teacher and principal](https://www.shippcampaign.com/about) in 5 CMS schools, a CMS parent and a CMS graduate. She was the 3rd highest vote-getter in the 2019 election for the same position and is the only incumbent vying for the role now. Her key areas of focus appear to be educational equity, school safety, more parent involvement, quality teachers and more elementary programs to support early achievement (in that order on her website). Shipp has 2 master’s degrees in various education fields. She is one of 3 endorsements by the Mecklenburg Democratic Party.  (\~Age 65,  Incumbent, Democrat, Black) 

**Omar Harris.** Harris has no digital footprint but [according to WFAE](https://www.wfae.org/politics/2023-07-21/fourteen-candidates-file-for-three-at-large-cms-school-board-seats), he is a CMS parent and moved to Charlotte about 18 months ago from Richmond, VA. 

**Brian Kasher.** Kasher is a CMS parent and taxpayer. He says he was “in leadership at CMS” for 8 years. His key issues are school safety (including air quality), measurable educational outcomes, school board culture change and serving all communities within Mecklenburg County.

(Age 44, Democrat, Black)

**Clara Kennedy Witherspoon**. Witherspoon is a former school counselor and CMS employee.

In an email to the Ledger, she said, “We need to find the revenues on a local level to either provide additional teacher raises or bonuses.”   She ran unsuccessfully for a BOE seat last November. Neither of the Witherspoon’s running are related to each other. Accessibility and responsiveness: A. (Age 66, Democrat, Black)

**Michael Johnson**. Johnson’s slogan is “innovate, education and elevate.” In an email to the Ledger, he said that one of the first things he’d like to do as a board member is “audit CMS’ finances.” Along with Covington and Albright, Johnson is on the Unity Slate which, according to the center-left organization Carolina Forward, [may have affiliations with the county Republican party](https://x.com/ForwardCarolina/status/1709536319938978209?s=20).

On her [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/meckvotes), she says that “adults must take back control of academic learning environments.” In an email to the Ledger, she said one of her first goals would be to “create safe school environments.” She had filed a lawsuit against CMS for wrongful termination (she believes it was because she filed a worker’s comp claim).

(Age 57, Unaffiliated, Black)

**Claire Covington.** Covington is a lawyer (specializing in intellectual property and data privacy) and mother of two daughters.

My name is John williams. I live in Charlotte, Nc. I am looking to get into marketing related roles whether that is product marketing or product research. 

A little bit about me I graduated from Drury University in MO with a marketing degree in 2019.  I interned at a digital marketing agency for half a year working on SEO related tasks. I then started a christian apparel brand, Woven Faith which has better clarified my interest in marketing as ive gotten to learn more about marketing, product development, better understanding the customers and their buying behaviors among other things. I took a job and moved to charlotte as a Resoltuion analyst in the logistics industry, being promoted to a sr resolution analyst. Ive been here just over 4 years. This is a non marketing related position but it moved me to the city I wanted to be in. I am looking to jump into marketing now.

And yes, it’s off schedule and the explanation for why is [here](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/politics/2022/05/19/5-things-to-know--charlotte-local-elections-will-be-july-26) (it has to do with decennial redistricting).

This will be a low turnout election but remember every election at every level matters. Please vote (early voting has already started).  Here is information on [early voting](https://www.mecknc.gov/BOE/Documents/early%20voting%20calendar%20for%20MECK2207.pdf). Election day is July 26, 2022. Also, all of these positions have a write-in option! If you don’t like any of these candidates, you can vote for whoever you want!

In this writeup, in addition to summaries of the candidates, I have also included an “accessibility and responsiveness” grade based on three things: whether the candidate provided contact information, if they responded to my outreach (and how quickly), and if the response was substantive. I only wrote to the mayoral candidates and the at-large candidates, as well as the candidate for District 7 because that’s where I live. I graded all those candidates on a scale from A-F. I must confess, I was disappointed to find that nearly all the incumbents were the most difficult to reach, perhaps because they were busy (and hopefully not because they took votes for granted, or that they lacked transparency which is a claim of many of the challengers below). As a constituent, I had hoped for better responsiveness. See below for commentary.

**Mayoral Candidates**

**Vi Alexander Lyles** (incumbent, Democrat, Black)**.** Lyles is currently in her second term as mayor.  She has worked in city government for years, including as a city council member and as mayor pro tem. She generally has a strong reputation in Charlotte. She has supported city improvement bonds, an expanded light rail, and job growth. The controversies that were public included the Republican party pulling the 2020 convention from the city because of disputes over mask issues, and another incident where her staff evidently [did not wear masks in public](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/charlottefive/c5-wellness/article246252950.html) at a restaurant. She also was allegedly going to be comped the initiation fee of $95k to join the Myers Park Country Club as an honorary member, and has not yet addressed that potential conflict of interest.  She generally has managed to steer clear of other controversial issues such as anything involving the CMPD and “the bathroom bill” though last summer (2021) the Charlotte City council did quietly pass an ordinance to ban any discrimination in public accommodations and rideshares (bathrooms were not included as evidently that is still restricted by the state law HB2).  Lyles has her bachelor’s degree from Queens University and an MPA from UNC Chapel Hill.

For accessibility and responsiveness, I gave Mayor Lyles a C. One of her staff members responded to me after my 2nd email to her and said she would respond as soon as she was able, but no one responded to me before I published this. I’ll update this grade if I hear back from her.

**Stephanie de Sarachaga-Bilbao** (Republican, Mexican-Italian).  She grew up in Charlotte since age 7 and graduated from Providence High.  She said her first job was at Boston Market at the Arboretum when she was 15. She has a background in entrepreneurship which she believes is the engine of growth for a city and the path out of poverty for citizens. She said she spent time in the start-up world in Israel and now invests in companies in Charlotte.  She considers herself a ""moderate Republican"" but also said that both parties have ""serious issues."" She said she felt that the current administration was unresponsive in recent crises (eg when city water pipes burst there little was communicated to residents, rampant homelessness, growing instances of violent crime) and that  encouraged her to run.  She felt that the role of Mayor was unique in that it helps to set the agenda, which she wouldn't have been able to do if she had run for another role like City Council.  When I asked her why she chose to align herself with the Republican party, she said that the way to make change was to ""go deep"" within the party and then loudly advocate for one's point of view.  She didn't mention many specific ideas about improving Charlotte, but she did suggest that the city could be better about helping its smaller non-profits that work on issues like homelessness or domestic violence, and she thought that Charlotte could support a program like a fashion school.  When asked about building bridges with Democrats who are the dominant party in Charlotte, she said that she was married to a Democrat (a police officer now).   She was endorsed by the Charlotte Observer during the May primary.

For accessibility and responsiveness, I give her a B+. I reached out 3 times (twice by email and once on the form field on her website) and she responded to me after the 3rd attempt. She emailed me asking to talk by phone or to meet.  When I finally connected with her by phone, she was polite, articulate and answered most of my questions directly, including why she was running.

**City Council at Large**

**Dimple Ajmera** (incumbent, age 36, Democrat, Asian). She loves Charlotte so much she actually named her daughter Charlotte (and has featured her toddler on her campaign collateral including her website). She was one of the Observer’s four endorsements during the May primary. She is a considered one of the city’s “millennial” council members and has been an advocate of climate change issues (she spoke at the rally when Greta Thunberg came to Charlotte in 2019).   One of the first issues listed on her site now is “a safe” Charlotte and she says that she doesn’t believe in “defunding the police.”  Other issues she mentions include a “sustainable infrastructure,” affordable housing and “economic opportunities in all parts of our city.” She ran for NC State Treasurer in 2020 (she’s an accountant by training) and lost in the primary though was regarded highly by the Observer at the time.  Her ethnicity is Indian and she is the City Council’s first Asian-American member. She finished second in the May primary.

For accessibility and responsiveness, I give her a D-. I reached out to her 3 times (twice by email, once on Twitter) over a week and received no response. Given that she is active on social media, I was surprised to not hear anything at all. If anyone knows her, please ask if she could respond (if she cares about this writeup) as I am happy to revise this grade.

**James (Smuggie) Mitchell** (a former member who resigned his post, age 60, Democrat, Black). He used to be on the city council (since 1999 when he first represented District 2) but then gave it up for a private sector job (a construction company that actually does 17% of its business with the city, mostly the airport), but then he left that job after a short time and appears to want to be back in the public sector.  There does appear to be an [unresolved conflict of interest](https://www.fox46.com/charlotte/former-charlotte-councilmember-who-wants-his-old-job-has-plan-to-eliminate-conflict-of-interest-issue/) as he holds 25% of that company (RJLeeper) and the city council’s limit is 10% if the city has contracts with that company.  He says if elected he will divest what he must to get down to the 10% level. Regarding affordable housing, he told me his two “babies” as a council member were Park at Oak Lawn and Siegle Point which are mixed income developments that address some of the affordable housing issues in those neighborhoods while supporting upward mobility for residents. He was a supporter of bringing the RNC to Charlotte in 2020.

For accessibility and responsiveness, I gave Mitchell an A. He didn’t respond to my first email but he did write back to me soon after I posted a comment on his Facebook page; he asked me to call him directly. He took my call shortly thereafter and politely and candidly answered the questions that I posed to him about affordable housing and his RJLeeper holdings.

**LaWana Slack-Mayfield** (incumbent, age 52, Democrat, Black). She is a left-leaning candidate who has a reputation for being outspoken on social issues.  She says she is also the “longest serving” council member to date. She lists her occupation as full-time student. The issues on her site are stable property values, smart economic growth (specifically training opportunities for 21st century jobs), and strong community safety. She received much criticism for calling police terrorists and questioning the 9/11 attacks. She was initially appointed to the state’s Human Relations Commission but had the role revoked by Governor Cooper after criticism from state house members.  That said, she, along with Winston and Ajmera, was endorsed by the Charlotte Observer before the city council primary in May.  She has had [financial difficulties in the past](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article170248332.html); she filed for bankruptcy in 2004.

I gave her an B+ for accessibility and responsiveness. She responded to a form that I submitted on her website within a day which was faster than all the other candidates except Leubke. But her responses were terse, one-sentence answers which were less useful than the thought or passion in the responses from some of the other candidates.

**Braxton David Winston II** (incumbent since 2017, age 39, Democrat, Black). He initially came to Charlotte fame as a “citizen journalist” during the Keith LaMott Scott riots and ran for public office following that. His key issues are affordable housing, local transportation infrastructure improvements (in particular mass transit and internet access/”digital inclusion”), and improving race relations in the city. He has faced a [few minor scandals](https://qcitymetro.com/2022/01/11/city-councilman-faces-criminal-summons/) over the years: he evidently has avoided child support payments and has been involved in various domestic altercations.  He finished first in the Democratic primary in May.

After 5 tries at reaching him over a few weeks, Winston finally wrote me back.  I gave him a B- for accessibility and responsiveness.  On one hand, he did list numerous ways to reach him including a form field on his website, but he was slower to respond than most of the other candidates. When he did write back though, his response was logical, clearly written and directly answered my questions.

**Kyle J Leubke** (age 32, Republican, White).  Leubke is supported by one of the city council’s only Republicans, Tariq Bokhari (Leubke was appointed by Bokhari as the District 6 rep Arts and Science Council). He says that his views are conservative even though he registered as a Democrat as recently as 2020. His positions seem to be moderate to liberal (giving tax breaks to struggling homeowners, supporting public transportation beyond the light rail, not supporting prosecution of abortion). He also supports a “regulatory environment where small businesses can flourish.”  Leubke is an openly gay Republican candidate and is an attorney with a local firm. His parents sent him to conversion therapy as a teenager.

I gave Leubke an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness (the highest for all the candidates I reached out to). He responded to my email within minutes and gave very thoughtful and data-filled responses about questions that I posed regarding affordable housing and local abortion ordinances. He also sent me his mobile number for any follow up I may have.

**David Merrill** (age 43, Republican, White). Key issues that Merrill cites on his site include public safety (it appeared to me that he wants to increase police funding as he views the current city administration has made Charlotte “less safe”), lower housing taxes, and enable affordable transportation. He seems to be moderate on social issues, suggesting that anti-gay or anti-abortion issues aren’t really things that he supports. He was one of the youngest people to ever achieve the rank of Eagle Scout.

I gave Merrill a B for accessibility and responsiveness. He responded after my 2nd outreach (on Twitter), but he did write back thoughtful paragraphs with several sentences about affordable housing and hypothetical abortion ordinances in Charlotte.

**Charlie Mulligan** (age 33, Republican, White). The issues listed on Mulligan’s website are affordable housing, accountable policing, and making things easier for small businesses. He disagrees with the Republican party with respect to “how consenting adults should live their personal lives.” He also favors decriminalizing cannabis. He’s a graduate of UNC Charlotte and most recently has been at a startup in the alcohol space and was a former documentary filmmaker. Mulligan's startup declared bankruptcy in 2019 and the company was accused at the time of allegedly ""ghosting"" (specifically, not paying bills of) craft brewers in Charlotte and on the West Coast.

For accessibility and responsiveness, I initially gave Mulligan a very low grade because there was no working contact information on his website. But after this post, he reached out to me directly and offered to answer any questions I had. He promptly responded to my questions and said that the broken links on his website were likely due to a 3rd party hosting glitch.  I raised Mulligan's score to C.  While there are still several hoops that one needs to jump through for constituents to reach him (his Twitter handle is charlie4thecity but that's not on his website and not something I would have known to type into search),  he was responsive to me when we finally did connect.  He said he would offer his contact information in the comments below if others want to connect with him directly.

**Carrie Olinski** (age 38, Republican, White). Olinski is a physician’s assistant (she says on her website she is a “functional medical practitioner”) and mother of a toddler girl. She quotes Rosa Parks on her website and mentions issues like public safety, supporting small businesses and transparency and accountability (this appears to be different from her messaging during the primary when she mentioned equitable healthcare). She does talk about being Christian so I suspect that she may lean more conservative on social issues though she appears to be moderate to liberal on economic issues.

I gave Olinski a B+ for accessibility and responsiveness (one of the higher scores). She responded after my 2nd email to her and asked for more time to think about my questions. She wrote back on Sunday, July 3 and in that email sent me 2 clear paragraphs with her thoughts. She was polite and warm in all of her communication.

**Other Candidates**

Here are the other candidates running for office. I only reached out to the candidate for District 7 as that is the one I vote for. If anyone has thoughts on the other candidates, please share in comments.

**District 1 (uncontested)**

**Dante Anderson** (age 49, Democrat, Black).  Anderson lists an opportunity to earn a livable wage, access to affordable housing and safe communities as key issues on her website.  She grew up in District 1 in Charlotte and says she was “reared in public housing.” She has a bachelor’s in electrical engineering from MIT and an MBA from Harvard Business School. She lists her current job as a VP of IT.

**District 2**

**Malcolm Graham** (incumbent, age 59, Democrat, Black). Graham is an experienced NC politician. He is a former member of the NC Senate and was also on the Charlotte City Council from 1999 to 2005.  The issues he lists on his site are community development and revitalization, public safety and police reform, affordable housing and racism and racial justice. He attended Johnson C Smith University on a tennis scholarship.  He is from Charleston SC and lost his sister in the mass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston in 2015.

**Mary Lineberger Barnett** (age 59, Republican, White). She describes herself as a “conservative, pro-public safety candidate.” She also believes that there is wasteful spending at the city and that the CLT 2040 plan has too much restrictive housing and rezoning initiatives (eg eliminating the ability to have duplexes in single family home neighborhoods).

**District 3**

**Victoria Watlington** (incumbent, age 35, Democrat, Black). Watlington is an engineer by training and is currently a “regional service operations manager.” She lists strong neighborhoods, engaged community leaders, traffic mitigation, and “opportunity for all” on her website.  She actually had concerns about the rezoning of single family home neighborhoods (to allow duplexes nearby) as well.

**James H Bowers** (Republican, Black). He mentions his love of God and being a Christian on the “about” section on his site and describes himself as a “conservative Republican.” The issues listed on his website are safety, security, trust and transparency.

**District 4**

**Renee Perkins Johnson** (incumbent, age 55, Democrat, Black). She is a former realtor. On her website she says that she is “a voice for Charlotte’s most vulnerable residents.” She thinks that Ballantyne for instance should offer more affordable housing. Her website is sparse but she does have some left-leaning posts about abortion rights and gun control on her Facebook page.

**District 5**

**Marjorie Molina** (age 42, Democrat). Molina lists earning a living wage, access to affordable housing and having a safe community as key issues on her website. She is fluent in Spanish and was an organizer for the Clinton campaign in 2016.

**District 6**

**Stephanie Hand** (age 55, Democrat, Black). She is a former manager in the airport industry and calls herself a “coalition builder.” The issues listed on her website include economic development, affordable housing, community safety and infrastructure. She has two adult children.

**Tariq Bokhari** (incumbent, age 42, Republican, mixed race). Bokhari has been in office since 2017 but has also been dogged by controversy, including nepotism toward his Carolina Fintech Hub (it supposedly received preferential COVID-19 support), and his role in having a teacher at his child’s elementary school removed from her role after an incident with that child. The key issues listed on his site are jobs, roads, and public safety. His name rhymes with “park.”

**District 7**

**Ed Driggs** (incumbent since 2013, in his 70s, Republican, White). Driggs is known for being one of the few Republicans on the city council (he represents the conservative Ballantyne area) and has been on the council since 2013. He says that one of his goals is to avoid tax increases. It appears he did not vote for the city’s non discrimination ordinance last year, in part because he was worried about unintended consequences for businesses (namely that some minority employees would be “untouchable”).  He also doesn't support the part of the Unified Development Ordinance that eliminates single family-only zoning.

I gave him a F for accessibility and responsiveness. I reached out 4 times: I emailed him and posted on his Facebook page where he appears to be active. I finally heard back from him 4 days before the election in spite of first having contacted him nearly a month prior.  In fact, I tried to reach out to him in 2019 when he ran last, and didn't hear from him then either. In 2019, his election for District 7 had more write-ins than any of the other races.  When he did write back, his answers were non-committal (re issues with affordable housing he said ""we haven't solved this yet"" but nothing on what he thought were the solutions which surprised me given how long he has been on the council).  When I suggested that he may want to respond to constituents in a faster timeframe, he wrote me back a response that was crotchety, thin-skinned and self-important.  He admonished me for my ""tone,"" said that he was so busy with city work that ""there are times when things pile up,"" and that I should ""slow a little more respect for the demands of the job.""  I candidly thought that was an odd response with an election a few days away.   I'd expect to hear that from a school teacher but not a publicly elected official.

These council members will actually have another election next year it appears.  I do think there is an opportunity for someone to be a competitive candidate in this district given this council member's disorganization and attitude.",1657246315.0,CitizenProfane,"Election for Charlotte City Council and Mayor Are Happening Now: Here's What's on the Ballot Yes, there is yet another election this month, this time for city council and mayor.

**City Council at Large**

**Dimple Ajmera** (incumbent, age 36, Democrat, Asian). She loves Charlotte so much she actually named her daughter Charlotte (and has featured her toddler on her campaign collateral including her website). She was one of the Observer’s four endorsements during the May primary. She is a considered one of the city’s “millennial” council members and has been an advocate of climate change issues (she spoke at the rally when Greta Thunberg came to Charlotte in 2019).

**Carrie Olinski** (age 38, Republican, White). Olinski is a physician’s assistant (she says on her website she is a “functional medical practitioner”) and mother of a toddler girl. She quotes Rosa Parks on her website and mentions issues like public safety, supporting small businesses and transparency and accountability (this appears to be different from her messaging during the primary when she mentioned equitable healthcare). She does talk about being Christian so I suspect that she may lean more conservative on social issues though she appears to be moderate to liberal on economic issues.

I gave Olinski a B+ for accessibility and responsiveness (one of the higher scores). She responded after my 2nd email to her and asked for more time to think about my questions. She wrote back on Sunday, July 3 and in that email sent me 2 clear paragraphs with her thoughts. She was polite and warm in all of her communication.

**Other Candidates**

Here are the other candidates running for office. I only reached out to the candidate for District 7 as that is the one I vote for. If anyone has thoughts on the other candidates, please share in comments.

**District 1 (uncontested)**

**Dante Anderson** (age 49, Democrat, Black).  Anderson lists an opportunity to earn a livable wage, access to affordable housing and safe communities as key issues on her website.  She grew up in District 1 in Charlotte and says she was “reared in public housing.” She has a bachelor’s in electrical engineering from MIT and an MBA from Harvard Business School. She lists her current job as a VP of IT.

**District 2**

**Malcolm Graham** (incumbent, age 59, Democrat, Black). Graham is an experienced NC politician. He is a former member of the NC Senate and was also on the Charlotte City Council from 1999 to 2005.  The issues he lists on his site are community development and revitalization, public safety and police reform, affordable housing and racism and racial justice. He attended Johnson C Smith University on a tennis scholarship.  He is from Charleston SC and lost his sister in the mass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston in 2015.

**Mary Lineberger Barnett** (age 59, Republican, White). She describes herself as a “conservative, pro-public safety candidate.” She also believes that there is wasteful spending at the city and that the CLT 2040 plan has too much restrictive housing and rezoning initiatives (eg eliminating the ability to have duplexes in single family home neighborhoods).

**District 3**

**Victoria Watlington** (incumbent, age 35, Democrat, Black). Watlington is an engineer by training and is currently a “regional service operations manager.” She lists strong neighborhoods, engaged community leaders, traffic mitigation, and “opportunity for all” on her website.  She actually had concerns about the rezoning of single family home neighborhoods (to allow duplexes nearby) as well.

**James H Bowers** (Republican, Black). He mentions his love of God and being a Christian on the “about” section on his site and describes himself as a “conservative Republican.” The issues listed on his website are safety, security, trust and transparency.

**District 4**

**Renee Perkins Johnson** (incumbent, age 55, Democrat, Black). She is a former realtor. On her website she says that she is “a voice for Charlotte’s most vulnerable residents.” She thinks that Ballantyne for instance should offer more affordable housing. Her website is sparse but she does have some left-leaning posts about abortion rights and gun control on her Facebook page.

**District 5**

**Marjorie Molina** (age 42, Democrat). Molina lists earning a living wage, access to affordable housing and having a safe community as key issues on her website. She is fluent in Spanish and was an organizer for the Clinton campaign in 2016.

**District 6**

**Stephanie Hand** (age 55, Democrat, Black). She is a former manager in the airport industry and calls herself a “coalition builder.” The issues listed on her website include economic development, affordable housing, community safety and infrastructure. She has two adult children.

**Tariq Bokhari** (incumbent, age 42, Republican, mixed race). Bokhari has been in office since 2017 but has also been dogged by controversy, including nepotism toward his Carolina Fintech Hub (it supposedly received preferential COVID-19 support), and his role in having a teacher at his child’s elementary school removed from her role after an incident with that child. The key issues listed on his site are jobs, roads, and public safety. His name rhymes with “park.”

**District 7**

**Ed Driggs** (incumbent since 2013, in his 70s, Republican, White). Driggs is known for being one of the few Republicans on the city council (he represents the conservative Ballantyne area) and has been on the council since 2013. He says that one of his goals is to avoid tax increases. It appears he did not vote for the city’s non discrimination ordinance last year, in part because he was worried about unintended consequences for businesses (namely that some minority employees would be “untouchable”).  He also doesn't support the part of the Unified Development Ordinance that eliminates single family-only zoning.

I gave him a F for accessibility and responsiveness. I reached out 4 times: I emailed him and posted on his Facebook page where he appears to be active. I finally heard back from him 4 days before the election in spite of first having contacted him nearly a month prior.  In fact, I tried to reach out to him in 2019 when he ran last, and didn't hear from him then either. In 2019, his election for District 7 had more write-ins than any of the other races.  When he did write back, his answers were non-committal (re issues with affordable housing he said ""we haven't solved this yet"" but nothing on what he thought were the solutions which surprised me given how long he has been on the council).  When I suggested that he may want to respond to constituents in a faster timeframe, he wrote me back a response that was crotchety, thin-skinned and self-important.  He admonished me for my ""tone,"" said that he was so busy with city work that ""there are times when things pile up,"" and that I should ""slow a little more respect for the demands of the job.""  I candidly thought that was an odd response with an election a few days away.   I'd expect to hear that from a school teacher but not a publicly elected official.

These council members will actually have another election next year it appears.  I do think there is an opportunity for someone to be a competitive candidate in this district given this council member's disorganization and attitude.",neutral,election charlotte city council mayor

"Charlotte Can’t Legalize Marijuana, but They Can Do Something","SAVE FOR LATER: https://qcnerve.com/charlotte-cant-legalize-marijuana-but-they-can-do-something/

Federally, marijuana legalization will happen by 2025. Mark it down. Still yet, it may happen sooner, depending on how the politics play out.

Why, you ask? Money. According to New Frontier Data, the U.S. marijuana industry as a whole does $50 billion in annual sales consistently, and that number is growing. Legal state markets alone will exceed $17 billion in sales in 2020.

While N.C. Sen. Jeff Jackson recently stated on Queen City Nerve’s Nooze Hounds podcast that he does not realistically see our Republican-led state legislature budging on legalization anytime soon, there are steps our city can take on a local level to prepare for the future, and it begins with stomping out the harmful, often racist policies of the present and past. Beyond the gross potential sales from marijuana is the amount of money already invested.

There are companies with billions of dollars put into the marijuana sector — publicly traded companies and pension funds — and all that money was invested by some very smart people with one belief: Marijuana becomes fully legalized by 2025.

Our government, as clueless as it may seem, will not fail their friends in Wall Street and big industry — all those Boomers with retirement in sight — by not making this move. It could happen sooner if Democrats were to win the presidency and a congressional majority later this year.

At the state level, medical marijuana could be here sooner than we think. A recent Elon University poll showed North Carolinians support medical marijuana enactment by 82% — no small stat in an election year. Perhaps more importantly, look at two of our neighboring states — Georgia and Virginia, both of whom have enacted medical marijuana programs. Even South Carolina is running a test facility in partnership with cannabis testing facilitator ProVerde Laboratories, according to Columbia Business Report.

Marijuana is now a regional opportunity. It has grown bigger than just one state deciding to move forward. Look at Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In October, all four governors took part in the Regional Cannabis and Vaping Summit to discuss how to legalize adult-use together. Leaders from Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Colorado attended, as well. These officials realize that legalization does not happen in a vacuum, as all surrounding states will be affected.

Not only is Virginia starting a robust and industrial medical marijuana program with a giant production facility being built within 30 miles of the N.C. border, but Governor Ralph Northam, M.D., just announced his primary legislative task in 2020 is to decriminalize cannabis and expunge marijuana arrests records in the state. Meanwhile, the Governor of Virginia just announced that the War on Drugs was severely biased in its effects and that criminal justice reform regarding marijuana and the people it negatively impacted must be his top priority.

Our leaders in Charlotte need to start working towards marijuana legalization progressively. The Charlotte City Council recently held its annual retreat, where members discussed topics like public transportation, home prices, MLS soccer and a high murder rate. What I encourage our city’s leadership to discuss is ending the enforcement of marijuana simple possession in Charlotte in 2020.

End of simple possession enforcement — along with record expungement — will go a long way to help heal some of our past mistakes and open up more opportunities for mobility. Many people have trouble getting a good job, or a loan, or even a lease due to an arrest for possession of a small amount of marijuana, an issue that disparately affects the black community in Charlotte.

Our criminal justice system should not adversely affect someone’s livelihood as a punitive measure for possessing a plant, not to mention that enforcing these antiquated laws takes resources from a police department that already claims to be 200 officers short, but these are all issues for a future column.

End of enforcement would signal to Raleigh and the rest of the country that Charlotte is progressive about marijuana — not that Raleigh cares. The marijuana industry is and will continue to boom, but it will only bring prosperity to cities and counties that welcome the progress.

Our city leaders ask us to think progressively and to support public transportation, greenway space and the arts. These are all good things, but they do come with a price tag. A progressive city could pay for our future needs and create thousands of jobs — not to mention funding the arts — if they would be open to these changes.

Ending enforcement and implementing expungement will help so many Charlotteans with criminal records, while also helping CMPD function more effectively in accommodating a modern, fast-growing city. End of enforcement will mean our city is open to thinking about alternative ways to create jobs and opportunity and equity for all of Charlotte.

Other cities like Atlanta; New York; and Austin, Texas, are ending marijuana enforcement. Charlotte should too.",1581544634.0,QueenCityNerve,"Charlotte Can’t Legalize Marijuana, but They Can Do Something SAVE FOR LATER: https://qcnerve.com/charlotte-cant-legalize-marijuana-but-they-can-do-something/

Election Summary Sheet: What’s on the Democratic Ballot in South Charlotte,"Here is my 4th election recap (I started these 4 years ago). Also, this is the link for the Republican ballot in South Charlotte (the post below is the Democratic ballot only): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/uj8ut3/election\_summary\_sheet\_republican\_primary/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/uj8ut3/election_summary_sheet_republican_primary/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

This shouldn’t have to be said, but it’s not only super important for everyone to vote, but also to be educated when you go to the polls. That’s why this is such a long post. In the past, only 72% of Mecklenburg County’s registered voters cast a ballot (November 2020).  Twenty-seven percent of Mecklenburg County voters voted in the 2020 primary.  Only 11% (!) of voters voted in the 2018 midterm primary.

For this election, I’ve tried to pull what I could about each of the candidates that draws from anything they’ve said or done publicly or online, as well as information in the media or social networks that has been written about them. If you know something more that you think voters should consider, please write it in the comments.

Please note, you may have other candidates on your ballot, especially for City Council and Board of Commissioners. Look here ([https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/)) for what your specific ballot looks like.

&#x200B;

**US Senate**

There are many, many candidates running for Richard Burr’s seat. In fact, this is the greatest number of candidates running for NC US Senate in many decades (going back to the 1960s). Only the Democrat and Republican candidates will have a primary but expect more than a half dozen other independent and small party candidates to be on the ballot in November. (If you’re wondering about the order of candidates, evidently, that is selected [by lottery](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=1273166149873818) by the State Board of Elections.) The slate of candidates includes 8 Black candidates and 4 women.

Here are the candidates for on the Democratic ballot:

**Cheri Beasley** (frontrunner, age 56). Beasley was the former Chief Justice of the NC Supreme Court. She was appointed to that role by Governor Roy Cooper in 2019 and had been a state supreme court justice since 2012. She had to run for Chief Justice in 2020 and lost by a margin of \~400 votes to Paul Newby (there was a recount). She was a public defender in Cumberland County (home of Fayetteville) prior.  The key issues cited on her website are access to affordable healthcare, improving education for children (reducing debt for college grads, increasing funds for early education), and helping employment with a higher minimum wage.  Many of her comments and website pages reflect the positions of the Democratic party (women’s rights, climate change, fighting company price gouging) but she also said “both parties have failed NC.”  If she were elected, she would be the only Black female Senator. (There are currently 3 Black male US Senators.) She has received a number of endorsements including from Jeff Jackson who was running against her initially but is now running for House of Representatives (District 14).  She is Black and has vastly [outraised every candidate](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&id=NCS2) in the race ($8MM to date vs $4MM for Pat McCrory).

**James L Carr Jr.** (age 55) Carr is a Black IT consultant and former accountant. He served in the military for 4 years and is a graduate of UNC Charlotte. He lists being Christian in big letters on his homepage and in his filing says he is from Harrisburg.  In [this interview](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/voter-guide/article260328065.html), he lists his top issues as healthcare, infrastructure and privacy rights (which he also says are tied to Roe v Wade). Carr has never run for elected office before but says that the “lack of vision” that led to civil unrest and unnecessary COVID-19 deaths led him to run.

**Robert Colon** (age 33).  He ran for Congress for his home district (7) of Wilmington in 2020.  He lists being an Eagle Scout as one of his qualifications for running for US Senator and it appears he has a background in water and wastewater management.  He appears to have some positions that diverge from the Democratic party—he supports globalization for instance (free trade has historically been more of a capitalist position) and is a pacifist (“opposing war” and reducing spending on atomic weapons) which seems like a message that wouldn’t land well given the situation in Ukraine now. This [old interview](https://www.wect.com/2020/01/20/meet-robert-colon-candidate-democratic-primary-north-carolinas-seventh-congressional-district/) has a number of his positions and his background (he moved to NC and completed his GED at Cape Fear Community College.) This video unfortunately does not do him any favors as he does not have a particularly charismatic style. He is White.

**Alyssia Rose-Katherine Hammond** (age 34). She calls herself a “young African American social justice activist and advocate.”  Her website states very little about her positions or what she would do for NC but she states several times that if elected, she would be one of the youngest senators ever elected. She is from the Raleigh area.

**Constance (Lov) Johnson.** Johnson ran for NC Superintendent of Public Education in 2020 and lost in the primary.  She says she built an online k-12 school and a political magazine. Johnson’s key platform issues include teacher pay, recycling, parent classes and free lunch for all students. She comes from a family of four generations of teachers and is also a Black candidate. She has an extensive list of awards on her website dating back [to high school. ](https://constancelovjohnson.com/constance-lov-johnson-bio)

**Tobias LaGrone (age 54).** LaGrone is a pastor and psychotherapist and is also a self-described “conservative Democrat” who now lives in the Greensboro area but was originally from Mississippi. He has held no public office before. He calls himself a “[Bible -believing servant leader](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/voter-guide/article260469427.html).” Affordable housing is one of the first issues he talks about in [this interview](https://myfox8.com/your-local-election-hq/meet-tobias-lagrone-greensboro-man-who-wants-u-s-senate-nomination/).  With respect to his conservatism, he says that he is pro-life; comments to the media also suggest he is dismissive of progressive Democrats who support LGBTQ issues. He is Black.

**B.K. Maginnis (age 47).** Maginnis grew up in the Winston-Salem area and came from a working class background and currently lives in Charlotte. He served in the military and paid his own way through community college and university at UNC Greensboro. He is a former financial advisor (he says money management was important to him to help others as his own parents struggled with money). He says that Trump “shattered” his perception of America and that’s why he decided to run for office.  Aside from running for office (his first time running for office in fact) he says that he is now a “dedicated homemaker” as his wife works and he sold his financial advisor practice. His website is one of the more polished of all the candidates, and has a fairly extensive set of positions on everything from criminal justice and Supreme Court reform, to climate change and gun safety reform. He is White.

**Rett Newton** (age 62). Newton is the former (twice elected) mayor of Beaufort, NC (Outer Banks region) and was in the military for nearly 3 decades before that. Having been the major of a coastal town, he is now pursuing a PhD in Marine Science and Conservation at Duke. Similar to Cheri Beasley, the top item cited on his site is health care for all, followed by a call to raise the minimum wage, and then climate change. Less prominent on his site are issues related to women’s or minority rights; no where does he say that he is pro-choice. He believes that green energy can be a new source of jobs and business for NC.  In interviews, he expressed disappointment that Beasley was determined the front runner so early in the race. He is White.

**Marcus W. Williams (age 69).** Williams ran for NC Attorney General in 2016 but lost in the primary. He describes himself as a “fiscal tightwad.” He does support the 2015 Paris climate accord and supports a “pay as you go” approach for federal programs. He did not appear to have an opinion on Roe v Wade in an Observer interview.   He is from Lumberton and is Black.

**Greg Antoine.** Antoine is from Fayetteville and is a doctor (plastic surgeon, actually) and veteran who retired as a Colonel in the Army.  As a doctor, he dealt with many opioid cases in the military community (he was Chief of Staff at a Veterans Affairs healthcare system).  His ties to NC really only appear to be that he came to work here for the Veterans Affairs system; he spent time in other regions near Boston, Atlanta and Cleveland prior. The key issue on his website is voter rights, followed by immigration. He actually believes we need to police the border more to stop the “narc terrorist organizations that have contributed to America’s opioid addiction crisis.”  He has a MD from SUNY Buffalo as well as an MBA and an MPA (UT Knoxville and UNC Chapel Hill respectively).  He is Black.

**Chrelle Booker.** Booker is the mayor pro tempore of Tryon NC and also seems to hold a number of other positions as a realtor and in broadcasting.  She lists equality and racism first on her website, followed by voting rights. She also lists medical cannabis but not the environment.  She is Black.

**US House of Representatives District 14**

This is [a new district](https://charlotte.axios.com/289383/jeff-jackson-is-running-for-the-new-14th-congressional-district-seat/) that only recently was determined after much drama in the courts. Jackson is likely to be winner as he is a stalwart in Charlotte politics and has a significant amount of money from his Senate bid but Mammadov also seems to be an earnest contender.

**Jeff Jackson (age 39).** Remember Jeff Jackson was running a seemingly promising campaign for US Senate but then dropped out of that race (he evidently can spend the \~$800k he has left in that race toward this one). He has been a state senator representing the Dilworth area for years. The redistricting dramas led to the new district he is running for which was only finalized in April and is considered to be [“solid Democrat](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings).” Jackson is the former assistant DA for Mecklenburg County and has been a state senator since 2014. He is a veteran and member of the Army National Guard (he’s in his 20th year in the military). He is “one of the most recognizable politicians in the county.”  He cites “ending gerrymandering” as one of his top priorities if elected. He has voted against bills that make it harder for NC citizens to access dash cam footage and proposed legislation for universal background checks. He does not refer to abortion on his website (though in an Observer interview he said he would “protect that freedom”) but does talk about supporting the ERA. He also doesn’t talk too much about climate change other than to support renewable energy. He thinks increasing [domestic manufacturing of microchips](https://www.semiconductors.org/chips/) (through subsidies) would reduce inflation. Jackson finished undergrad at Emory and received his JD from UNC Chapel Hill. He is White and the father of three (two boys and a girl).

**Ram Mammadov (age 42).** Ram is Azerbaijani and came to the US (specifically Michigan) at age 20. He moved to NC 15 years ago with an IT job. He appears to be the father of 2 young boys. He is running because he sees America as a “beacon of hope.” He supports term limits and lists education and climate change as the top issues of concern on his website. He feels that the public schools are in “disarray” (in spite of sending his two children to public school). He supports renewable energy sources to support climate change and to provide new jobs.  He supports the Voter’s Right Act and says Congress should pass a law affirming abortion if Roe is overturned. Interestingly, he ran for a state senate seat in South Carolina in the past.

&#x200B;

**District Court Judge, District 26, Seat 19**

District courts hear civil, juvenile, traffic and domestic cases.

**Belal Elrahal (age 33).** Elrahal is Lebanese-American, a native Charlottean and a graduate of CMS (Harding High School). He is also an officer in the US Army Reserve and a former JAG attorney. He was an assistant public defender and in a family law private practice. He graduated from Davidson and UNC Chapel Hill law school. This is his first time running for public office.

**Samantha C. Mobley.** Mobley is currently a magistrate (and has been in that role for 8+ years) and says on her website that she is most interested in family law and placing children in appropriate foster care situations. She has lived in Charlotte since going to law school (she attended Charlotte School of Law).  She is Black.

&#x200B;

**NC District Court Judge, District 26, Seat 1**

District courts hear civil, juvenile, traffic and domestic cases.

**Christopher Bazzle** (age 41). Bazzle is currently a court magistrate for several years and has been a member of the NC Bar since 2009. He appears to be a progressive candidate as he blogs about interactions with the LGBTQ community and his endorsement by the Black Political Caucus of the county. He is White.

**Shante Burke Hayer** (age 33). She is a native North Carolinean and has been a lawyer for 10 years.  She is in a family law practice in Charlotte and she is most proud she says that she ran it through the pandemic. She doesn’t believe there are significant differences between her and her opponent. She is Black.

**District Attorney**

There is no Republican contender so whoever wins this race will be the next District Attorney for Mecklenburg County.

**Timothy (Tim) Emry.** Emry is a far left candidate and says he is running for DA because of concerns around public safety, particularly that rogue police officers are “held accountable when they break the law.” He pledges to never seek the death penalty and that he won’t prosecute women or doctors who get abortions should the NC Legislature pass an abortion ban. He is in private practice in Charlotte. He was previously an assistant public defender. He was part of a team of lawyers that sued the CMPD for gassing protesters during various race riots in the past, and was a supporter of “decarcerating” inmates in Mecklenburg County jails during COVID-19. He has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrezKGFE64qP50hIeG7ASaA/videos) where he posts videos on Wednesdays about various topics like criminalizing homelessness. He is White and grew up in Nebraska but has lived in Charlotte since 2002.

**Spencer Merriweather (incumbent).** One thing to note about Merriweather was that there was a scathing expose [(“Death in the Fast Lane”)](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article252181668.html) about how fatalities on our highways are often tied to previously convicted felons who were driving illegally, but that the DA’s office simply didn’t have resources to put enough of these people behind bars. The absence of convictions is correlated to Merriweather being in office. During his tenure, he created a special victims unit and unlike Emry didn’t promise to never seek the death penalty. He also advocates taking illegal guns off the street and giving non-violent drug offenders a second chance. He is Black.

&#x200B;

**Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners at Large (we can vote for 3)**

These people determine the budget of the city and sets the county property tax rate.  It also operates agencies like the health department. WFAE describes it as [“a city council for the county.” ](https://www.wfae.org/politics/2022-04-20/in-charlotte-the-nc-primary-includes-city-council-and-county-offices-heres-what-to-know)

**Patricia (Pat) Cotham** (incumbent, age 72). Cotham is in her 5th term on the board of commissioners. She is an advocate of school choice and fair housing. She calls herself a “broad-based Democrat” who does not want to defund the police. She is a trustee of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center. She is White.  She is endorsed by the Observer.

**Jennifer De La Jara** (age 48). She is currently on the CMS Board of Education (elected in 2019). She is a mother of two and white. Her priorities on her website are education, economic development and environmental stewardship and parks. She wants to increase funding for schools and to reduce the time to build new schools. Her last name is pronounced “de la harra” and she is bilingual (Spanish).

**Arthur Griffin Jr.** (age 73) Griffin was a long-time public official in Charlotte. He was the on the CMS Board of Education for 17 years and was chairman for 5 years though he hasn’t held public office for 20 years. He is a military veteran and worked in the legal profession as a paralegal. He is a trustee of CPCC and a native Charlottean. He believes in workforce preparedness and affordable housing. He is Black and is endorsed by the Observer.

**Yvette Townsend-Ingram** (age 51). The key issues listed on her website are “wraparound services” for families, food insecurity and business support for underrepresented minorities. She believes a tutoring agency could correct the disparities of CMS. She has never run for public office before. She is Black and is endorsed by the Observer who says the commission needs “a fresh face.”

**Leigh Altman** (incumbent, age 50).  The key issues on her website are “innovative jobs initiatives,” mental health support and public school equity. She has 3 boys in CMS. She is an attorney by training (the only attorney currently on the commission) and moved to Charlotte in 2009. She is white and the great-granddaughter of Holocaust survivors. She spoke strongly in an Observer interview about “anti-Israel voices” in the Democratic party. She says she has championed Workforce Development in the county.

**Trina V Boyd** (age 37).  Boyd is a small business owner and former PTSA vice president from a CMS elementary school who hasn’t run for office before. The issues she lists on her website are educational funding and affordable housing.  She supports night daycare for families who work night shifts. She is Black.

&#x200B;

**Mecklenburg County Sheriff**

This position has jurisdiction over the county jail and employs 1100 people and has been surprisingly contentious.

**Garry L McFadden (incumbent, age 62).** McFadden was the 45th (and first Black) Sheriff of Mecklenburg County. He was a homicide detective for the CMPD for decades prior. He focuses on building better relationships between law enforcement and local communities, and “restoring the humanity” in prisons and confinement. He was known for not enforcing ICE raids on undocumented individuals back when he was elected. There was at least one negative comment from a Reddit user who also said they were a jail employee and that McFadden didn’t listen and created a bad working environment. That person preferred Robinson.

**Aujiena (Gina) Hicks.** Hicks is from NY (she worked at Rikers Island in her past) and has worked for 18 years in the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s office. During that time, she describes her career as “unblemished” [though this article suggests](https://www.tuesdayforumcharlotte.org/2022/03/29/sheriffs-race/) she may have been fired by McFadden and is running out of spite.  She believes that the detention facilities are “unsafe” and that is due to poor leadership by McFadden. She is Black.

**Marquis D Robinson.** Robinson is a recently retired deputy who worked in the sheriff’s office for 25 years.  He wants to start a human trafficking unit and ensure that domestic violence orders are served more quickly. Both Hicks and Robinson believe there is a staff morale problem in the sheriff’s office as well as an overcrowding issue. Robinson is also a pastor and is Black.

&#x200B;

**Charlotte Mayor**

**Vi Alexander Lyles (incumbent).** Lyles is currently in her second term as mayor.  She has worked in city government for years, including as a city council member and as mayor pro tem. She generally has a strong reputation in Charlotte. She has supported city improvement bonds, an expanded light rail, and job growth. The few controversies that were public included the Republican party pulling the 2020 convention from the city because of disputes over mask issues, and another incident where her staff evidently [did not wear masks in public](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/charlottefive/c5-wellness/article246252950.html) at a restaurant.  She generally has managed to steer clear of other controversial issues such as anything involving the CMPD and “the bathroom bill” though last summer (2021) the Charlotte City council did quietly pass an ordinance to ban any discrimination in public accommodations and rideshares (bathrooms were not included as evidently that is still restricted by the state law HB2).  Lyles has her bachelor’s degree from Queens University and an MPA from UNC Chapel Hill.

**Tigress Sydney Acute McDaniel.** She is a perennial candidate who runs for something seemingly every election but has never won. She has run for the Soil & Water Conversation Board and for the Board of Commissioners in the past.  The primary reason to not vote for her is that she is a convicted felon (she was convicted in Greensboro of identity theft). She has an hour-[long (and painfully long-winded) video on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=639365207165671) trying to defend herself.  She says she is a professionally trained dancer and studying to be a lawyer. She is Black.

**Tae McKenzie (age 38).** McKenzie is a model and disability activist. She requires a wheelchair because of a stroke that she had back in 2011 due to a rare form of epilepsy. She has drafted laws to permit CBD oils but doesn’t appear to have other political experience. It seems that she may be running to draw awareness to causes that are important to her rather than to actually win.

**Lucille Puckett.** She doesn’t appear to have a website. She ran for mayor in 2013 (and evidently 2 other times as well) and was a member of the Charlotte Housing Authority Board. Her 26 year old son was shot to death in an altercation near her home in 2016.  She is Black.

&#x200B;

**City Council At Large (we can vote for up to 4)**

Just a note: after this primary, the final city council election will actually be this summer, NOT in November .

**Dimple Ajmera (incumbent, age 36).** She loves Charlotte so much she actually named her daughter Charlotte (and has featured her toddler on some campaign mailers). She was one of the Observer’s four endorsements. She is a considered one of the city’s “millennial” council members and has been a fierce advocate of climate change (she spoke at the rally when Greta Thunberg came to Charlotte in 2019).   One of the first issues listed is “a safe” Charlotte and she says that she doesn’t believe in “defunding the police.” She ran for NC State Treasurer in 2020 and lost in the primary though was regarded highly by the Observer at the time.  Her ethnicity is Indian and she is the City Council’s first Asian-American member.

**Patrick D. Cannon.** Cannon was the former mayor of Charlotte who was imprisoned for 2 years due to accepting bribes while mayor. He then was also convicted of voting illegally (after he was convicted for accepting bribes) though he wasn’t given additional jail time for that offense. I would suggest not voting for Cannon. He too is a convicted felon and we should have a much higher bar for our elected officials. The Observer said “he was mistrusted” even before he was convicted and refused to endorse him.  He is Black.

**Larken Egleston** (incumbent though he currently represents District 1 vs at-large, age 40). Egleston has served for two terms on the City Council and is a salesperson for an alcohol distribution company. He says that he has fought for affordable housing, more green programs such as greenways, and the preservation of landmarks. He also thinks the city should be less “car centric.” He also is advocating for “social districts” in Charlotte where streets are marked off for people to take drinks outside a restaurant. He was a champion of the city’s 2021 non-discrimination ordinance. He is White.

**James (Smuggie) Mitchell** (a former member who resigned his post, age 60). He used to be on the city council but then gave it up for a private sector job (a construction company that actually does 17% of its business with the city), but then he left that job after a short time and appears to want to be back in the public sector.  There does appear to be an [unresolved conflict of interest](https://www.fox46.com/charlotte/former-charlotte-councilmember-who-wants-his-old-job-has-plan-to-eliminate-conflict-of-interest-issue/) as he holds 25% of that company (RJLeeper) and the city council’s limit is 10% if the city has contracts with that company. He is the only candidate other than former convicted felon Patrick Cannon, to not receive an Observer endorsement.  There appear to be a number of typos in [this interview with the Observer](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/voter-guide/article260466112.html) about his views (it’s unclear if those were his or the Observer’s). He was a supporter of bringing the RNC to Charlotte in 2020. Mitchell is Black.

**LaWana Slack-Mayfield** (former councilmember, age 52). She is a far left candidate who is very outspoken on social issues.  She is also the “longest serving” council member to date. She lists her occupation as full-time student. She received much criticism for calling police terrorists and questioning the 9/11 attacks. She was initially appointed to the state’s Human Relations Commission but had the role revoked by Governor Cooper after criticism from state house members.  That said, she along with Winston, Egleston and Ajmera, is endorsed by the Charlotte Observer.  She is Black.

**Braxton David Winston II** (incumbent, age 39). He initially shot to Charlotte fame as a “citizen journalist” during the Keith LaMott Scott riots and ran for public office following that. His key issues are affordable housing, local transportation infrastructure improvements (in particular mass transit and internet access), and improving race relations in the city. He has faced a [few minor scandals](https://qcitymetro.com/2022/01/11/city-councilman-faces-criminal-summons/) over the years: he evidently has avoided child support payments and has been involved in various domestic altercations.  In spite of all that, he is endorsed by the Observer as he is regarded as an articulate, youthful advocate of Charlotteans.  He is Black.",1651627851.0,CitizenProfane,"Election Summary Sheet: What’s on the Democratic Ballot in South Charlotte Here is my 4th election recap (I started these 4 years ago). Also, this is the link for the Republican ballot in South Charlotte (the post below is the Democratic ballot only): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/uj8ut3/election\_summary\_sheet\_republican\_primary/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/uj8ut3/election_summary_sheet_republican_primary/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

This shouldn’t have to be said, but it’s not only super important for everyone to vote, but also to be educated when you go to the polls. That’s why this is such a long post. In the past, only 72% of Mecklenburg County’s registered voters cast a ballot (November 2020).  Twenty-seven percent of Mecklenburg County voters voted in the 2020 primary.  Only 11% (!) of voters voted in the 2018 midterm primary.

For this election, I’ve tried to pull what I could about each of the candidates that draws from anything they’ve said or done publicly or online, as well as information in the media or social networks that has been written about them. If you know something more that you think voters should consider, please write it in the comments.

Please note, you may have other candidates on your ballot, especially for City Council and Board of Commissioners. Look here ([https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/)) for what your specific ballot looks like.

&#x200B;

**US Senate**

There are many, many candidates running for Richard Burr’s seat. In fact, this is the greatest number of candidates running for NC US Senate in many decades (going back to the 1960s). Only the Democrat and Republican candidates will have a primary but expect more than a half dozen other independent and small party candidates to be on the ballot in November. (If you’re wondering about the order of candidates, evidently, that is selected [by lottery](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=1273166149873818) by the State Board of Elections.) The slate of candidates includes 8 Black candidates and 4 women.

Here are the candidates for on the Democratic ballot:

**Cheri Beasley** (frontrunner, age 56). Beasley was the former Chief Justice of the NC Supreme Court. She was appointed to that role by Governor Roy Cooper in 2019 and had been a state supreme court justice since 2012. She had to run for Chief Justice in 2020 and lost by a margin of \~400 votes to Paul Newby (there was a recount). She was a public defender in Cumberland County (home of Fayetteville) prior.  The key issues cited on her website are access to affordable healthcare, improving education for children (reducing debt for college grads, increasing funds for early education), and helping employment with a higher minimum wage.  Many of her comments and website pages reflect the positions of the Democratic party (women’s rights, climate change, fighting company price gouging) but she also said “both parties have failed NC.”  If she were elected, she would be the only Black female Senator. (There are currently 3 Black male US Senators.) She has received a number of endorsements including from Jeff Jackson who was running against her initially but is now running for House of Representatives (District 14).  She is Black and has vastly [outraised every candidate](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&id=NCS2) in the race ($8MM to date vs $4MM for Pat McCrory).

**James L Carr Jr.** (age 55) Carr is a Black IT consultant and former accountant. He served in the military for 4 years and is a graduate of UNC Charlotte. He lists being Christian in big letters on his homepage and in his filing says he is from Harrisburg.  In [this interview](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/voter-guide/article260328065.html), he lists his top issues as healthcare, infrastructure and privacy rights (which he also says are tied to Roe v Wade). Carr has never run for elected office before but says that the “lack of vision” that led to civil unrest and unnecessary COVID-19 deaths led him to run.

**Robert Colon** (age 33).  He ran for Congress for his home district (7) of Wilmington in 2020.  He lists being an Eagle Scout as one of his qualifications for running for US Senator and it appears he has a background in water and wastewater management.  He appears to have some positions that diverge from the Democratic party—he supports globalization for instance (free trade has historically been more of a capitalist position) and is a pacifist (“opposing war” and reducing spending on atomic weapons) which seems like a message that wouldn’t land well given the situation in Ukraine now. This [old interview](https://www.wect.com/2020/01/20/meet-robert-colon-candidate-democratic-primary-north-carolinas-seventh-congressional-district/) has a number of his positions and his background (he moved to NC and completed his GED at Cape Fear Community College.) This video unfortunately does not do him any favors as he does not have a particularly charismatic style. He is White.

**Alyssia Rose-Katherine Hammond** (age 34). She calls herself a “young African American social justice activist and advocate.”  Her website states very little about her positions or what she would do for NC but she states several times that if elected, she would be one of the youngest senators ever elected. She is from the Raleigh area.

**Constance (Lov) Johnson.** Johnson ran for NC Superintendent of Public Education in 2020 and lost in the primary.  She says she built an online k-12 school and a political magazine. Johnson’s key platform issues include teacher pay, recycling, parent classes and free lunch for all students. She comes from a family of four generations of teachers and is also a Black candidate. She has an extensive list of awards on her website dating back [to high school. ](https://constancelovjohnson.com/constance-lov-johnson-bio)

**Tobias LaGrone (age 54).** LaGrone is a pastor and psychotherapist and is also a self-described “conservative Democrat” who now lives in the Greensboro area but was originally from Mississippi. He has held no public office before. He calls himself a “[Bible -believing servant leader](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/voter-guide/article260469427.html).” Affordable housing is one of the first issues he talks about in [this interview](https://myfox8.com/your-local-election-hq/meet-tobias-lagrone-greensboro-man-who-wants-u-s-senate-nomination/).  With respect to his conservatism, he says that he is pro-life; comments to the media also suggest he is dismissive of progressive Democrats who support LGBTQ issues. He is Black.

**B.K. Maginnis (age 47).** Maginnis grew up in the Winston-Salem area and came from a working class background and currently lives in Charlotte. He served in the military and paid his own way through community college and university at UNC Greensboro. He is a former financial advisor (he says money management was important to him to help others as his own parents struggled with money). He says that Trump “shattered” his perception of America and that’s why he decided to run for office.  Aside from running for office (his first time running for office in fact) he says that he is now a “dedicated homemaker” as his wife works and he sold his financial advisor practice. His website is one of the more polished of all the candidates, and has a fairly extensive set of positions on everything from criminal justice and Supreme Court reform, to climate change and gun safety reform. He is White.

**Rett Newton** (age 62). Newton is the former (twice elected) mayor of Beaufort, NC (Outer Banks region) and was in the military for nearly 3 decades before that. Having been the major of a coastal town, he is now pursuing a PhD in Marine Science and Conservation at Duke. Similar to Cheri Beasley, the top item cited on his site is health care for all, followed by a call to raise the minimum wage, and then climate change. Less prominent on his site are issues related to women’s or minority rights; no where does he say that he is pro-choice. He believes that green energy can be a new source of jobs and business for NC.  In interviews, he expressed disappointment that Beasley was determined the front runner so early in the race. He is White.

**Marcus W. Williams (age 69).** Williams ran for NC Attorney General in 2016 but lost in the primary. He describes himself as a “fiscal tightwad.” He does support the 2015 Paris climate accord and supports a “pay as you go” approach for federal programs. He did not appear to have an opinion on Roe v Wade in an Observer interview.   He is from Lumberton and is Black.

**Greg Antoine.** Antoine is from Fayetteville and is a doctor (plastic surgeon, actually) and veteran who retired as a Colonel in the Army.  As a doctor, he dealt with many opioid cases in the military community (he was Chief of Staff at a Veterans Affairs healthcare system).  His ties to NC really only appear to be that he came to work here for the Veterans Affairs system; he spent time in other regions near Boston, Atlanta and Cleveland prior. The key issue on his website is voter rights, followed by immigration. He actually believes we need to police the border more to stop the “narc terrorist organizations that have contributed to America’s opioid addiction crisis.”  He has a MD from SUNY Buffalo as well as an MBA and an MPA (UT Knoxville and UNC Chapel Hill respectively).  He is Black.

**Chrelle Booker.** Booker is the mayor pro tempore of Tryon NC and also seems to hold a number of other positions as a realtor and in broadcasting.  She lists equality and racism first on her website, followed by voting rights. She also lists medical cannabis but not the environment.  She is Black.

&#x200B;

**US House of Representatives District 14**

This is [a new district](https://charlotte.axios.com/289383/jeff-jackson-is-running-for-the-new-14th-congressional-district-seat/) that only recently was determined after much drama in the courts. Jackson is likely to be winner as he is a stalwart in Charlotte politics and has a significant amount of money from his Senate bid but Mammadov also seems to be an earnest contender.

**Jeff Jackson (age 39).** Remember Jeff Jackson was running a seemingly promising campaign for US Senate but then dropped out of that race (he evidently can spend the \~$800k he has left in that race toward this one). He has been a state senator representing the Dilworth area for years. The redistricting dramas led to the new district he is running for which was only finalized in April and is considered to be [“solid Democrat](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings).” Jackson is the former assistant DA for Mecklenburg County and has been a state senator since 2014. He is a veteran and member of the Army National Guard (he’s in his 20th year in the military). He is “one of the most recognizable politicians in the county.”  He cites “ending gerrymandering” as one of his top priorities if elected. He has voted against bills that make it harder for NC citizens to access dash cam footage and proposed legislation for universal background checks. He does not refer to abortion on his website (though in an Observer interview he said he would “protect that freedom”) but does talk about supporting the ERA. He also doesn’t talk too much about climate change other than to support renewable energy. He thinks increasing [domestic manufacturing of microchips](https://www.semiconductors.org/chips/) (through subsidies) would reduce inflation. Jackson finished undergrad at Emory and received his JD from UNC Chapel Hill. He is White and the father of three (two boys and a girl).

**Ram Mammadov (age 42).** Ram is Azerbaijani and came to the US (specifically Michigan) at age 20. He moved to NC 15 years ago with an IT job. He appears to be the father of 2 young boys. He is running because he sees America as a “beacon of hope.” He supports term limits and lists education and climate change as the top issues of concern on his website. He feels that the public schools are in “disarray” (in spite of sending his two children to public school). He supports renewable energy sources to support climate change and to provide new jobs.  He supports the Voter’s Right Act and says Congress should pass a law affirming abortion if Roe is overturned. Interestingly, he ran for a state senate seat in South Carolina in the past.

&#x200B;

**District Court Judge, District 26, Seat 19**

District courts hear civil, juvenile, traffic and domestic cases.

**Belal Elrahal (age 33).** Elrahal is Lebanese-American, a native Charlottean and a graduate of CMS (Harding High School). He is also an officer in the US Army Reserve and a former JAG attorney. He was an assistant public defender and in a family law private practice. He graduated from Davidson and UNC Chapel Hill law school. This is his first time running for public office.

**Samantha C. Mobley.** Mobley is currently a magistrate (and has been in that role for 8+ years) and says on her website that she is most interested in family law and placing children in appropriate foster care situations. She has lived in Charlotte since going to law school (she attended Charlotte School of Law).  She is Black.

&#x200B;

**NC District Court Judge, District 26, Seat 1**

District courts hear civil, juvenile, traffic and domestic cases.

**Christopher Bazzle** (age 41). Bazzle is currently a court magistrate for several years and has been a member of the NC Bar since 2009. He appears to be a progressive candidate as he blogs about interactions with the LGBTQ community and his endorsement by the Black Political Caucus of the county. He is White.

**Shante Burke Hayer** (age 33). She is a native North Carolinean and has been a lawyer for 10 years.  She is in a family law practice in Charlotte and she is most proud she says that she ran it through the pandemic. She doesn’t believe there are significant differences between her and her opponent. She is Black.

**District Attorney**

There is no Republican contender so whoever wins this race will be the next District Attorney for Mecklenburg County.

**Timothy (Tim) Emry.** Emry is a far left candidate and says he is running for DA because of concerns around public safety, particularly that rogue police officers are “held accountable when they break the law.” He pledges to never seek the death penalty and that he won’t prosecute women or doctors who get abortions should the NC Legislature pass an abortion ban. He is in private practice in Charlotte. He was previously an assistant public defender. He was part of a team of lawyers that sued the CMPD for gassing protesters during various race riots in the past, and was a supporter of “decarcerating” inmates in Mecklenburg County jails during COVID-19. He has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrezKGFE64qP50hIeG7ASaA/videos) where he posts videos on Wednesdays about various topics like criminalizing homelessness. He is White and grew up in Nebraska but has lived in Charlotte since 2002.

**Spencer Merriweather (incumbent).** One thing to note about Merriweather was that there was a scathing expose [(“Death in the Fast Lane”)](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article252181668.html) about how fatalities on our highways are often tied to previously convicted felons who were driving illegally, but that the DA’s office simply didn’t have resources to put enough of these people behind bars. The absence of convictions is correlated to Merriweather being in office. During his tenure, he created a special victims unit and unlike Emry didn’t promise to never seek the death penalty. He also advocates taking illegal guns off the street and giving non-violent drug offenders a second chance. He is Black.

&#x200B;

**Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners at Large (we can vote for 3)**

These people determine the budget of the city and sets the county property tax rate.  It also operates agencies like the health department. WFAE describes it as [“a city council for the county.” ](https://www.wfae.org/politics/2022-04-20/in-charlotte-the-nc-primary-includes-city-council-and-county-offices-heres-what-to-know)

**Patricia (Pat) Cotham** (incumbent, age 72). Cotham is in her 5th term on the board of commissioners. She is an advocate of school choice and fair housing. She calls herself a “broad-based Democrat” who does not want to defund the police. She is a trustee of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center. She is White.  She is endorsed by the Observer.

**Jennifer De La Jara** (age 48). She is currently on the CMS Board of Education (elected in 2019). She is a mother of two and white. Her priorities on her website are education, economic development and environmental stewardship and parks. She wants to increase funding for schools and to reduce the time to build new schools. Her last name is pronounced “de la harra” and she is bilingual (Spanish).

**Arthur Griffin Jr.** (age 73) Griffin was a long-time public official in Charlotte. He was the on the CMS Board of Education for 17 years and was chairman for 5 years though he hasn’t held public office for 20 years. He is a military veteran and worked in the legal profession as a paralegal. He is a trustee of CPCC and a native Charlottean. He believes in workforce preparedness and affordable housing. He is Black and is endorsed by the Observer.

**Yvette Townsend-Ingram** (age 51). The key issues listed on her website are “wraparound services” for families, food insecurity and business support for underrepresented minorities. She believes a tutoring agency could correct the disparities of CMS. She has never run for public office before. She is Black and is endorsed by the Observer who says the commission needs “a fresh face.”

**Leigh Altman** (incumbent, age 50).  The key issues on her website are “innovative jobs initiatives,” mental health support and public school equity. She has 3 boys in CMS. She is an attorney by training (the only attorney currently on the commission) and moved to Charlotte in 2009. She is white and the great-granddaughter of Holocaust survivors. She spoke strongly in an Observer interview about “anti-Israel voices” in the Democratic party. She says she has championed Workforce Development in the county.

**Trina V Boyd** (age 37).  Boyd is a small business owner and former PTSA vice president from a CMS elementary school who hasn’t run for office before. The issues she lists on her website are educational funding and affordable housing.  She supports night daycare for families who work night shifts. She is Black.

&#x200B;

**Mecklenburg County Sheriff**

This position has jurisdiction over the county jail and employs 1100 people and has been surprisingly contentious.

**Garry L McFadden (incumbent, age 62).** McFadden was the 45th (and first Black) Sheriff of Mecklenburg County. He was a homicide detective for the CMPD for decades prior. He focuses on building better relationships between law enforcement and local communities, and “restoring the humanity” in prisons and confinement. He was known for not enforcing ICE raids on undocumented individuals back when he was elected. There was at least one negative comment from a Reddit user who also said they were a jail employee and that McFadden didn’t listen and created a bad working environment. That person preferred Robinson.

**Aujiena (Gina) Hicks.** Hicks is from NY (she worked at Rikers Island in her past) and has worked for 18 years in the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s office. During that time, she describes her career as “unblemished” [though this article suggests](https://www.tuesdayforumcharlotte.org/2022/03/29/sheriffs-race/) she may have been fired by McFadden and is running out of spite.  She believes that the detention facilities are “unsafe” and that is due to poor leadership by McFadden. She is Black.

**Marquis D Robinson.** Robinson is a recently retired deputy who worked in the sheriff’s office for 25 years.  He wants to start a human trafficking unit and ensure that domestic violence orders are served more quickly. Both Hicks and Robinson believe there is a staff morale problem in the sheriff’s office as well as an overcrowding issue. Robinson is also a pastor and is Black.

&#x200B;

**Charlotte Mayor**

**Vi Alexander Lyles (incumbent).** Lyles is currently in her second term as mayor.  She has worked in city government for years, including as a city council member and as mayor pro tem. She generally has a strong reputation in Charlotte. She has supported city improvement bonds, an expanded light rail, and job growth. The few controversies that were public included the Republican party pulling the 2020 convention from the city because of disputes over mask issues, and another incident where her staff evidently [did not wear masks in public](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/charlottefive/c5-wellness/article246252950.html) at a restaurant.  She generally has managed to steer clear of other controversial issues such as anything involving the CMPD and “the bathroom bill” though last summer (2021) the Charlotte City council did quietly pass an ordinance to ban any discrimination in public accommodations and rideshares (bathrooms were not included as evidently that is still restricted by the state law HB2).  Lyles has her bachelor’s degree from Queens University and an MPA from UNC Chapel Hill.

**Tigress Sydney Acute McDaniel.** She is a perennial candidate who runs for something seemingly every election but has never won. She has run for the Soil & Water Conversation Board and for the Board of Commissioners in the past.  The primary reason to not vote for her is that she is a convicted felon (she was convicted in Greensboro of identity theft). She has an hour-[long (and painfully long-winded) video on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=639365207165671) trying to defend herself.  She says she is a professionally trained dancer and studying to be a lawyer. She is Black.

**Tae McKenzie (age 38).** McKenzie is a model and disability activist. She requires a wheelchair because of a stroke that she had back in 2011 due to a rare form of epilepsy. She has drafted laws to permit CBD oils but doesn’t appear to have other political experience. It seems that she may be running to draw awareness to causes that are important to her rather than to actually win.

**Lucille Puckett.** She doesn’t appear to have a website. She ran for mayor in 2013 (and evidently 2 other times as well) and was a member of the Charlotte Housing Authority Board. Her 26 year old son was shot to death in an altercation near her home in 2016.  She is Black.

&#x200B;

**City Council At Large (we can vote for up to 4)**

Just a note: after this primary, the final city council election will actually be this summer, NOT in November .

**Dimple Ajmera (incumbent, age 36).** She loves Charlotte so much she actually named her daughter Charlotte (and has featured her toddler on some campaign mailers). She was one of the Observer’s four endorsements. She is a considered one of the city’s “millennial” council members and has been a fierce advocate of climate change (she spoke at the rally when Greta Thunberg came to Charlotte in 2019).   One of the first issues listed is “a safe” Charlotte and she says that she doesn’t believe in “defunding the police.” She ran for NC State Treasurer in 2020 and lost in the primary though was regarded highly by the Observer at the time.  Her ethnicity is Indian and she is the City Council’s first Asian-American member.

**Patrick D. Cannon.** Cannon was the former mayor of Charlotte who was imprisoned for 2 years due to accepting bribes while mayor. He then was also convicted of voting illegally (after he was convicted for accepting bribes) though he wasn’t given additional jail time for that offense. I would suggest not voting for Cannon. He too is a convicted felon and we should have a much higher bar for our elected officials. The Observer said “he was mistrusted” even before he was convicted and refused to endorse him.  He is Black.

**Larken Egleston** (incumbent though he currently represents District 1 vs at-large, age 40). Egleston has served for two terms on the City Council and is a salesperson for an alcohol distribution company. He says that he has fought for affordable housing, more green programs such as greenways, and the preservation of landmarks. He also thinks the city should be less “car centric.” He also is advocating for “social districts” in Charlotte where streets are marked off for people to take drinks outside a restaurant. He was a champion of the city’s 2021 non-discrimination ordinance. He is White.

**James (Smuggie) Mitchell** (a former member who resigned his post, age 60). He used to be on the city council but then gave it up for a private sector job (a construction company that actually does 17% of its business with the city), but then he left that job after a short time and appears to want to be back in the public sector.  There does appear to be an [unresolved conflict of interest](https://www.fox46.com/charlotte/former-charlotte-councilmember-who-wants-his-old-job-has-plan-to-eliminate-conflict-of-interest-issue/) as he holds 25% of that company (RJLeeper) and the city council’s limit is 10% if the city has contracts with that company. He is the only candidate other than former convicted felon Patrick Cannon, to not receive an Observer endorsement.  There appear to be a number of typos in [this interview with the Observer](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/voter-guide/article260466112.html) about his views (it’s unclear if those were his or the Observer’s). He was a supporter of bringing the RNC to Charlotte in 2020. Mitchell is Black.

**LaWana Slack-Mayfield** (former councilmember, age 52). She is a far left candidate who is very outspoken on social issues.  She is also the “longest serving” council member to date. She lists her occupation as full-time student. She received much criticism for calling police terrorists and questioning the 9/11 attacks. She was initially appointed to the state’s Human Relations Commission but had the role revoked by Governor Cooper after criticism from state house members.  That said, she along with Winston, Egleston and Ajmera, is endorsed by the Charlotte Observer.  She is Black.

**Braxton David Winston II** (incumbent, age 39). He initially shot to Charlotte fame as a “citizen journalist” during the Keith LaMott Scott riots and ran for public office following that. His key issues are affordable housing, local transportation infrastructure improvements (in particular mass transit and internet access), and improving race relations in the city. He has faced a [few minor scandals](https://qcitymetro.com/2022/01/11/city-councilman-faces-criminal-summons/) over the years: he evidently has avoided child support payments and has been involved in various domestic altercations.  In spite of all that, he is endorsed by the Observer as he is regarded as an articulate, youthful advocate of Charlotteans.  He is Black.",positive,election summary sheet democratic ballot south charlotte election recap started year ago also link republican ballot south charlotte post democratic ballot http http said super

Which Charlotte suburb has the best appreciation potential where I can raise my family?,"I know it’s hard to go wrong in Charlotte when one is looking at home appreciation potential, however, I would be grateful for some insight into which suburban neighborhoods have strong economic development plans and good, not the best (6-8), schools.

I’ll be in Charlotte for a couple days and would like to make the most of my visit. So far I have looked a some homes Highland Creek, Huntersville, Mooresville, and Davidson (beautiful, but likely outside of our $$ Range). I really liked some neighborhoods in HC, but others felt crowded. I’d prefer to live in a neighborhood with mature trees, parks/pools/playgrounds, if possible, and don’t mind living on the edge of the city/country. 

I’ll be looking to work at either UNC-C or to get back into the banking industry for a year or two until another opportunity presents itself. My background is banking (MBA) and federal grant management for public universities. Please share any suburbs/neighborhoods that will best suit our needs. We also have some money set aside to purchase a rental prop or two, but first want to find our next primary residence and settle in. Thanks!

Any dark/hipster/cozy coffee shops?,"We moved here from Northern Minnesota and there was a Caribou Coffee with a loft that my wife really liked working at. It wasn't really bougie, or modern, or bright. Picture a coffee shop in a city that gets winter for 8 months of the year and only gets 6 hours of sunlite a day :)

She's tried finding something similar in Charlotte but hasn't really found the same feeling. Does anyone know a place like this?

Of course it doesn't help that we're in university which seems to have a lack of coffee shops in general. ",1717773280.0,cbroughton80,"Any dark/hipster/cozy coffee shops?

What I don't understand about the politics of CLT mass transit,"Blue line has had low frequency for awhile now, and has had a couple trains derail in the past couple years (one of which was only reported months after the fact). NC DOT also told the city they couldn't run both Gold and Blue lines at the same time if they couldn't properly staff the control center (which had been a problem).

Here's what I don't understand about this whole situation... and would appreciate insight from those with more knowledge of city politics than I.

**Blowing this is expensive**

Building overpasses for the Blue line that follow Tryon Street going north to UNCC is expensive. Installing Gold line could not have been cheap either (e.g., rebuilding Hawthorne bridge over HWY 74 to support the tram car). It seems very, very costly to neglect the system, leaving its future at such high-risk. Surely, if you've spent a lot of money on major capital investments, you want to protect those investments, right?

**Where is the blowback?**

News reports on transit (e.g., [on consideration of building the Silver line](https://www.wfae.org/charlotte-area/2022-12-05/charlotte-moves-towards-a-northern-route-for-the-silver-line-light-rail)) have pointed out that the rail system is terrific for development. It's also pretty plain to see that the light rail spurred significant development throughout South End, through Noda, and more recently up to University City. But of course, mismanaging the rail threatens the continued operation of existing rail lines (as well as new rail), which threatens the value of nearby land.

Development / real estate is thought to be pretty powerful in city politics. I guess I would have just expected more real estate folks / developers to be publicly unloading on the gross incompetence of city leadership because this is an obvious threat to their interests.

Less than 24 hours and I already hate this city,"I moved into my apartment in Charlotte last night from the tristate area. On Google Maps, it said that Walmart closed at 11. When we paid for an Uber to get there (since there was no public transit), it was closed and had been since 10. In what universe does WALMART close at 10pm?!?!

Then, we started walking around to try to find any other stores that were open. Legit everything was closed, and it was insanely hard and dangerous to cross the roads. 

At one point, my roommate started to cross a street and almost got hit by a car turning left, and the driver said ""watch the fucking road"", to which I yelled ""shut the fuck up"". Standard road rage banter where I'm from, but this was a mistake. The driver and his friend legit walked up to us 20 minutes later as we were waiting for another Uber and proceeded to slap the shit out of me. And, apparently, that's ""getting off easy"" here.

An Open Letter to UNCC

I write this letter alone in my room, the space where I have so carefully confined myself to for the past five months. The same place I was told would be the safest place to do my job. The same place where I completed ten credit hours successfully during the summer semester. The same place I was sent in March when there were an estimated 300 COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, when Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency, closing our university. 

I sit here today in the same state, only now I am surrounded by 1,972 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Yet, I am expected to return to campus in 18 days. I, along with the majority of the country, have lived in fear for almost half of a year. I have awakened every single day since March wondering which of my friends will be the next to contract the virus, wondering which of my high-risk parents would be more likely to survive this sickness, wondering if that tightness in my chest is particles in my lungs which will render me sick and permanently crippled or if it is just anxiety. I wake up each day wondering which grocery store trip will be the one that kills me. I am so used to this constant state of worry now that these fears plaguing my head are my new normal. However, I have never felt this trepidation as strongly as I do today. 

On Monday, August 10th, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill hosted its first day of class for the fall 2020 semester. Within one week, UNC’s COVID-19 case count rose by 135 cases, according to the school’s paper, The Daily Tarheel. This rise in positivity was not-so-shockingly 5 times the positivity rate from the prior week. Let’s take a moment to discuss these numbers: The 135 cases recorded only account for the positive test results of students. This number does not include those who were not tested, those who potentially received false negatives, or those who came into contact with each of these 135 individuals and now have to isolate or quarantine. After this whopping spike in cases, UNC’s students pushed the university to move to an all-online semester through petitions and articles. 

On Monday, August 10th, North Carolina State University hosted its first day of classes for the fall semester. Since this day, over 500 students have been ordered to isolate or quarantine. Today, on August 20th, NC State announced it would also be moving to an all-online semester beginning August 24th. Are we seeing the pattern?
On Monday, September 7th, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte will be hosting its first day of classes. If UNCC officials act today to move the fall semester online, we could break this pattern. We have the power now to avoid the countless impending cases and deaths of members of our own institution. We have the time now to fully prepare each course to fit an online setting; a luxury NC State and UNC Chapel Hill do not have. 

I am writing this letter as a cry for help; to ask my university to call off in-person classes for the sake of my peers, my professors, the entirety of the staff, and for the sake of our city as a whole. I have stayed home, I have distanced myself from both my family and my friends for their protection and mine, and I have worn a mask each time I have had to venture into public. I have done my part. Now, it is time to do yours.",1598056124.0,Madd-scientits,"Petition to UNCC to move classes online Here’s a petition to UNCC to move online before the start of the semester in order to avoid an inevitable spike in Covid cases in Charlotte!

What’s On The Ballot: The September 12 Primary,"Another year, another election writeup. It’s always time-consuming to research the candidates on a ballot so I hope this saves some of you effort and educates you as you vote. 

You may be asking, why are we electing the major and city council for a 2 year term when we just voted on these positions last July? Because the 2021 election was delayed one year due to delayed Census data. Because of that, the winners of the 2019 election served 3 years and the 2022 election winners served one. We are back on cycle now. 

The votes happening now are only for the Democratic primary. Only registered Democrats and Unaffiliated voters can vote. The general election with Republican and other candidates will happen after the September 12 primary. Below are all the candidates appearing on this Democratic primary ballot.  Here is also a list of voting sites and dates for this primary: [https://mecknc.widen.net/s/fmzwkt2rlt/early-voting-september-23](https://mecknc.widen.net/s/fmzwkt2rlt/early-voting-september-23)

**Mayor of Charlotte**

**Vi Lyles.** Lyles is currently in her third term as mayor and the first Black woman to be mayor of Charlotte. In a WSOC interview, she said her priority is “creating safe and livable neighborhoods that provide opportunities for employment and efficient transportation to and from those jobs.” She has worked in city government for years, including as a city council member and as mayor pro tem. She generally has a strong reputation in Charlotte. She has supported city improvement bonds, an expanded light rail, and job growth. She generally has managed to steer clear of controversial issues such as anything involving the CMPD and “the bathroom bill” though in the summer of 2021 the Charlotte City council did quietly pass an ordinance to ban any discrimination in public accommodations and rideshares (bathrooms were not included as evidently that is still restricted by the state law HB2). Lyles has her bachelor’s degree from Queens University and an MPA from UNC Chapel Hill. 

**Lucille Puckett.** This is 55-year-old Puckett’s fourth time running against Lyles for mayor and according to her, her fifth run overall. Puckett has slowly improved her results in recent elections: she captured 7% of vote during the Democratic primary in May 2022, 4% of the vote in September 2019 and <1% in 2017. Puckett stated in an Observer interview that “violence and safety and housing” are issues of concern to her. Her 26-year-old son was shot to death in an altercation near her home in 2016.  She was a member of the Charlotte Housing Authority Board which tried to remove her from the role in 2011. 

**At-Large Council Candidates (vote for up to 4)**

**Dimple Ajmera.** Ajmera has served on the city council since 2017 and received the highest number of votes in the last city council election which was July 2022.  The top three issues she lists on her website are public safety, affordable housing and the environment. She voted to approve the controversial Unified Development Ordinance from last August (it allows denser housing in single-family neighborhoods).  She is the first Asian-American on the Charlotte city council and named one of her daughters Charlotte. She is a former accountant and now works full-time with the city council. She ran unsuccessfully for NC state treasurer in 2020.  

**Ben Copeland.** Copeland is a 21-year-old UNCC finance student who graduated from Myers Park High School in 2021.  In an Observer interview, he said he is running to inject “youthful perspectives and innovative ideas.” He mentioned the housing crisis a few times in that interview. On his website, he says his priorities are affordable housing, enhanced infrastructure (easing traffic congestion), modernizing Charlotte (smart city connections) and attracting investment.  He worked on Dan McCready’s Congressional campaign. He earned a pilot’s license in high school and is a small business owner of a passport expediting service. 

**Charlene Henderson El.** Henderson is a 54-year-old small business owner (she seems to have both a hair salon and a podcast studio though her website leads to a dead link). She calls herself a “mother, survivor and advocate.” In an Observer interview, she said she supports using public money for the Bank of America stadium improvements if it “creates jobs and benefits the district.” She has had a number of committee roles for the city and county (including chair of Precinct 82 of the Mecklenburg County Democrats) and said she ran for the District 4 seat of the city council in the past. 

**Victoria Watlington.** Watlington is an engineer by trade and has been on the city council serving District 3 (West Charlotte/Steele Creek area) since 2019. On her website, she lists strong neighborhoods (“Re-Imagining Policing Framework”), engaged community leaders (amplification of District 3 on the city planning commission), a connected city (about congestion mitigation) and opportunity for all (investments in local neighborhoods for job creation). Watlington voted against the Unified Development Ordinance from last August (it allowed for denser housing in single-family neighborhoods). She attended the University of Florida with a full academic scholarship and has a PhD in Infrastructure and Environment Systems. She has received a number of civic awards. 

**James (Smuggie) Mitchell Jr.**  Sixty-one year old Mitchell has been a long-time council member (for many years representing District 2 and now an at-large member). I talked to him prior to the last election and he then said that regarding affordable housing, his two “babies” were Park at Oak Lawn and Siegle Point which are mixed income developments that address some of the affordable housing issues in those neighborhoods while supporting upward mobility for residents.  Mitchell was sworn back into the city council just after the previous council passed the Unified Development Ordinance in August 2022. There was scuttlebutt about a conflict of interest with a business he worked with (RJLeeper which has some city contracts) but those issues appear to be resolved. He is married to astronaut Joan Higginbotham, the 3rd African-American woman to go to space. 

**LaWana Slack-Mayfield.** Mayfield is also a city council incumbent, having been the District 3 rep from 2011-18 and is now an at-large member. She says she is running again because there is still work to do. She said in an interview with the Charlotte Ledger that Charlotte has become segregated and the success of the city hasn’t been evenly distributed. She mentions stable property values, smart economic growth and strong community safety as her key areas of interest on her website. She has served on a number of local boards including National League of Cities and LGBTQ+ Local Officials and listed her occupation in a 2022 interview with the Observer as housewife. She received much criticism in the past for calling police terrorists and questioning the 9/11 attacks. She was initially appointed to the state’s Human Relations Commission but had the role revoked by Governor Cooper after criticism from state house members. She has had financial difficulties in the past and filed for bankruptcy in 2004. 

**District 2: the northern part of Charlotte including Wesley Heights**

**Malcolm Graham.** Graham is the District 2 incumbent and has been a long-time council member. He is a former member of the NC Senate and was also on the Charlotte city council from 1999 to 2005.  The issues he lists on his site are community development and revitalization, public safety and police reform, affordable housing and racism and racial justice (the same as when he last ran in 2022). He attended Johnson C Smith University on a tennis scholarship.  He is from Charleston, SC and lost his sister in the mass shooting at Mother Emanual AME church in Charleston in 2015. He voted in favor of the UDO from last August.

**Gary Linn Young II.**  The issues that Young lists on his website are homeowner protection, public safety, workforce development and economic development. Young is a Charlotte native and a businessman who was the Chairman and President of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Black Chamber of Commerce. Young is currently the Supplier Diversity Manager at Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate company. 

**District 3: the west side of Charlotte**

This opening has no incumbent as Victoria Watlington is running for an at-large council seat. 

**Tiawana Deling Brown.** Brown mentions increasing affordable housing on her site, as well as improving transportation and workforce development opportunities. She was born in District 3 and is the founder of the nonprofit Beauty After the Bars, which aims to keep women, girls and youth out of prison. She served a 5-year sentence in a federal prison in West Virginia (incidentally, the same one where Martha Stewart served) for fraud charges and gave birth to her youngest daughter there. 

**Melinda Lilly.** Lilly lists community, accessibility and integrity as three items on the “platform” page of her website but she doesn’t list any specific programs or initiatives. Her website says that she worked for the Alliance for Climate Education but her LinkedIn profile says she worked for the same amount of time at Action for Climate Emergency. She says she was chair of the LGBTQ Democrats of Mecklenburg County.  

**Warren F Turner.** Turner is a Charlotte native who lists “smart growth,” transportation and public safety as the top items on his priorities and platform list on his website. He said in an Observer interview that he would like to see Charlotte become a carbon neutral city.  Turner was a former council member who served District 3 from 2003-11. He was investigated for sexual harassment incidents during that tenure. 

**District 4: the northeaster part of Charlotte including I85**

**Renee Perkins Johnson.** Johnson is a former realtor and currently the incumbent from District 4. On her website she says that she is “a voice for Charlotte’s most vulnerable residents.” She is a mother and grandmother and thinks that Ballantyne should offer more affordable housing. Her website is sparse but she does have some left-leaning posts about abortion rights and gun control on her Facebook page. 

**Wilbert (Wil) Dequan Russell.** Russell previously ran for the District 4 seat in 2013 and 2017 and has served on a number of local city committees. Rusell is currently a “senior construction manager” and said in an Observer interview that what separates him from his opponents is experience in zoning, housing and construction. 

**Olivia Simone Scott.** Scott lists her priorities as protecting District 4’s tree canopy and green spaces, safety and sustainability, smart development and affordable housing, including rental caps. She said she is a “successful business owner” but I found no information on what that business is. Scott ran unsuccessfully for the Board of Education in 2017 and 2019. 

**District 5: the eastern part of the city near North Sharon Amity and Rama Roads**

**Marjorie White Molina.** Molina lists earning a living wage, access to affordable housing and having a safe community as key issues on her website. She is fluent in Spanish and was an organizer for the Clinton campaign in 2016.

**Vinroy Reid.** Reid mentions infrastructure, economic development and community service as the top three issues on his site as well as “uplifting the homeless and creating opportunities.” He is the owner of Mama’s Caribbean Grill as well as a licensed general contractor and ran unsuccessfully in 2017 and 2019 for the District 5 seat. 

**Curtis M Hayes Jr.** Hayes appears to be the father of two and supports affordable housing, a minimum wage increase and “efficient and public transportation” according to his website.

Uptown Charlotte reminds me of North Korea,"Some background: this past weekend I drove from Philadelphia to Clemson University with a couple friends to see the total solar eclipse (which was everything I hoped for and more, but I digress). On the way down we saw an awesome skyline and had some amazing food at Amélie's.

We left Clemson late Monday afternoon and decided to stay in Charlotte for the night and drive the rest of the way on Tuesday, having a good impression so far. We booked a room at the Omni Charlotte on Trade Street, arriving around 9:00pm.

Driving into the city, I was struck by how clean and bright everything was, almost immaculate. After an hour or so we decided to explore a bit, and that's where it gets strange:

- We left the hotel and started walking to the Epicentre, a couple hundred feet away at most. Within 10 seconds a guy walked up to us and asked if we wanted to buy any drugs.
- Understanding that this is a Monday night, we are in the middle of the central business district surrounded by *massive* office buildings, and usually you have a few people going out for drinks after work or what not. Most places were completely empty, we stopped at the busiest place which had maybe 5-6 people. Everyone was nice, we left after maybe 30 minutes.
- We walked a couple blocks to another bar, and during that time we were aggressively panhandled twice, with another guy asking us if we needed drugs. I'm no stranger to cities, but this is a bit excessive. By this time we are noticing that the streets are completely empty, and more homeless are taking residence on benches.
- We left to head back to the hotel a little after midnight, and we were followed for 1.5 blocks by another aggressive panhandler. After I turned him down, we noticed all of the passed out homeless completely filling benches and adjacent sidewalks. Picking up the pace, we approached some construction scaffolding next to our hotel entrance and I saw a shadow moving below the fence. I immediately detoured into the street and a dude jumped out. Before he could get a word out I told him to back off and he ran away.

Now this is just a personal anecdote, but this place seriously weirds me out. I've traveled to a lot of cities and have never experienced anything like this. I think our count was at 3 drug dealers and 3 or 4 panhandlers approaching us in the span of maybe 30 minutes outside, in the *central business district*.

By morning, the streets were swept clean and well-dressed business people were walking around. It could very well be that the homeless occupying the benches were turned into Soylent Green, and fed to other homeless. The skyscrapers were probably empty shells, with lights turned on and off at random intervals to maintain the illusion of activity, much like the North Korean Demilitarized Zone. The entire city appeared to be under the economic control of Bank of America and Wells Fargo, as if it were some kind of grotesque social experiment.

It was incredibly surreal. I look forward to my next visit!",1503523041.0,zip117,"Uptown Charlotte reminds me of North Korea Some background: this past weekend I drove from Philadelphia to Clemson University with a couple friends to see the total solar eclipse (which was everything I hoped for and more, but I digress).

Best smaller towns/cities outside of Charlotte?,"I’ve been here a little over six months now and I think I’m going to stick around. However, I’m considering finding a place a bit outside of Charlotte. Some place with a cute little downtown or something would be nice and I’d also like to be close enough to come into the city a couple of weekends a month. Im not opposed to going across the boarder to SC but don’t really know which towns are better than others. I work in the University area so I don’t want to be crazy far from work. My commute is currently around 20 minutes each way but I’m used to commuting up to an hour. Feel free to throw out suggestions!

Election Summary Sheet: Republican Primary Candidates in South Charlotte,"Happy Cinco de Mayo!

This is my 4th election writeup since 2018; I had to split up the Republican and Democrat candidates because the list was too long.

Here is my summary of the Republican primary ballot. I added salary information where I could find it to this writeup. I thought some people may want to know how much taxpayers pay for each of these roles.

To see the writeup for the Democratic ballot, here it is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/uhvd27/election\_summary\_sheet\_whats\_on\_the\_democratic/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/uhvd27/election_summary_sheet_whats_on_the_democratic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Your specific ballot will likely be slightly different because of various local positions you will need to vote for. To find your ballot, it’s available here: [https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/)

Here are the positions and people on most of the Republican ballots in South Charlotte:

**US Senate**

This is for Richard Burr’s seat. US Senators receive a salary of $174k per year.There are even more Republicans running for this position than Democrats (it’s one of the most crowded races in decades).

A single candidate must win more than 30% of the votes in order to avoid a summer runoff (which would be the top 2 candidates). Hopefully one day there will be ranked choice voting.  Several of the candidates below are fringe contenders at best, with incomplete or nonexistent websites, no clear positions on key issues, and barely any money raised. The four leading contenders however are heavily financed with allegations of significant [dark money supporting their campaigns](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article261038787.html#subtopper).  In debates between McCrory, Eastman and Walker, they all are against student debt forgiveness, sending troops to Ukraine and teaching critical race theory in schools (Budd refused to attend the debates and Eastman didn’t qualify to be in the most recent debate.)

Here are the candidates:

**Pat McCrory** (1 of 2 frontrunners, age 65). McCrory was the mayor of predominantly Democratic Charlotte (from 1995-2009) and was the governor of North Carolina after that (from 2013-17). He was also a former longtime Duke Energy employee. The key issues he lists on his website are creating jobs and limiting taxes, investing in the military, supporting the police and approving conservative judges. McCrory has been endorsed by the Observer even though he “was a far different governor than after 7 terms as a moderate Charlotte mayor.” He did sign the notorious “bathroom bill” (HB2 which lost NC many business deals) into law in 2016. He claims that he balanced NC’s budget as governor (he cut programs like Medicaid and unemployment benefits when the NC legislature also had Republican majorities). At the same time, he did increase the education budget and teacher pay. There is some suspicion that he was involved in Duke Energy’s getting off easy on pollution and environmental issues like coal ash disposal. Both McCrory and Budd have raised about $4MM each (directly, not counting dark money) and both are White.

**Ted Budd** (1 of 2 frontrunners, age 51). Budd is a 2 term Congressman in what was a heavily gerrymandered district around the Greensboro area. He is also the owner of a gun range.  He is endorsed by Trump and did not appear in any of the Republican primary debates to the dismay of his opponents (only McCrory, Eastman and Walker have been in the debates).  He was also one of the Republicans who objected to the certification of the 2020 presidential election. His website says that he is a “liberal agenda crusher.”  The top issue listed on his website is Big Tech censorship and the “sanctity of life.” Protecting guns is 3rd issue listed. The rest of his topics are fairly standard conservative issues—parental freedom in education, integrity in elections, “stopping socialism,” etc. He and his wife homeschooled their children and he met his wife on a mission trip. He graduated from App State and has an MBA from Wake Forest.  He has supposedly been supported by $8MM+ additional campaign funds through dark money groups.

**Marjorie K Eastman** (age 43).  Eastman and her husband are both military veterans (she served in Afghanistan). She appears to be a motivational speaker and author now. Her school age son is a cancer (neuroblastoma) survivor. She says she believes in term limits and wants to return “to the Reagan era” (free enterprise, peace). She says that “defunding the police is one of the most idiotic ideas to come from the far left.” She supports most traditional conservative positions like a strong military, low taxes, individual rights and education, but she also supports “conserving the environment.”  She also believes that China and the US are “at odds.” She is from Wake Forest, NC. She is the 3rd most funded Republican candidate and is White.

**David Flaherty** (age 69).  He is a retired citizen (seemingly a former lawyer) and believes the government spends “way too much” and that more restrictions on law-abiding citizens are a bad idea. He’s run for statehouse offices before (district court judge, district attorney). He appears to be from a small town between Raleigh and Fayetteville.

**Benjamin E Griffiths.** He did post on his Facebook page “the real fix to Congress is TERM LIMITS” (sic). There is very little available about him otherwise. His Facebook page has 27 followers. He appears to be White.

**Kenneth Harper Jr**. Harper calls himself a “rational conservative.” He was a teen father just after high school and then became a small store owner and eventually a car salesman. He talks a lot in his bio about his financial troubles in life.  He lists very little of his platform other than “affordable healthcare” and “protecting the lives of the unborn.” He is the father of three grown women and is Black.

**Charles Kenneth Moss** (age 82). He is an evangelist preacher and has run for Governor twice before. He has considered himself a “moderate conservative” (at least from an interview in 2016, as there is very little that is available about him now).

**Lichia Sibhatu** (age 65). Sibhatu was born in Eritrea and is currently a daycare owner. She lists “diversity” as one of the top things on her website. She is Black.

**Debora Tshiovo** (est age early 20s). Tshiovo calls herself a conservative Christian. She attended the University of Maryland and makes no mention of any North Carolina ties. Many of the issues she lists on her website like prison reform and national security are blank. She does however have a paragraph about abortion. She is Black.

**Mark Walker** (age 52). Walker is a former pastor and is now a Congressman for a district in the Greensboro area. He claims that he doesn’t engage in mudslinging. The top issues listed on his site are saving taxpayers money, combatting sexual assault and human trafficking, and a balanced budget amendment. Like Eastman, he mentions being anti-China on his website. He mentions little to nothing about the environment on his site. Walker is just behind Eastman in fundraising (and far behind McCrory and Budd). He is the father of three and White.

**Jen Banwart** (age 45). She worked for many years at the Department of Defense and has a background in counterterrorism. She lives in the Raleigh area and is very anti-big government. She says that the way to fight inflation is to reduce the size of the federal government. She also believes that the private sector has the best solutions for climate change. Interestingly her website seems to suggest that “politics of individualism” and issues like abortion are “tertiary” for her. She is White.

**Ms. Lee A Brian** (age 38). She is currently a charter bus driver. She has run for a house seat in the past and was a write-in candidate against Thom Tillis. She says that if Roe is overturned that she would create a bill that “states life begins at conception regardless of how the child was conceived.”  She also believes in term limits. There appear to be no photos of her online and she doesn’t have any endorsements. She has bizarre links to “white hat websites” on her site.

**Leonard L Bryant** (age 53). He was a veteran in the military for most of his career (several decades). His platform is vague but he wants to “protect the Constitution on a federal level,” “stand for conservative values,” and stop the censoring of conservatives. He believes critical race theory censors conservatives. He is Black.

**Drew Bulecza** (age 59). He is a salesman and horse breeder. He appears to be a far right candidate. He believes that wind mills are a scam and solar panels are insufficient. He wants to abolish Planned Parenthood and arm more citizens to reduce violent crime. He is White.

&#x200B;

**US House District 14**

This is a new district which the Cook Report describes as “solid Democrat.” Congressmen, like Senators, receive $174k per year as salary.

**Pat Harrigan** (age 35). Harrigan is a former Green Beret and graduate of West Point. He does support renewable energy as a source of jobs and managing climate control. He says defunding the police is not an option and that voter IDs should exist.  It is unclear if Harrigan resides in District 14 (though that isn’t a requirement for running). His address listed with the board of elections is in Hickory, NC. He is White.

**Jonathan Simpson** (age 33). Simpson is a veteran and a businessman but has no prior public service experience. His website cites school choice and a “pro-growth tax code” as his top issues. He also does cite environmental issues as a concern (his site is selling t-shirts that say “go green-go nuclear”).  He is endorsed by the Observer in the primary. He is White.

&#x200B;

**NC Supreme Court Associate Justice Seat 5**

Judgeships comprise a significant part of the ballot (and will be even bigger in November). These positions below are all state court judges, starting with the highest level: the NC State Supreme Court, followed by Appellate Courts. The act of judges listing their political affiliation on the ballot started relatively recently in 2017.

There are 7 State Supreme Court judges who get 8 year terms. The salary is $156k.

**Victoria E Prince** (approx. age late 20s). She was only admitted to the bar in 2019 and is an attorney in private practice. She admits that she is not “a seasoned judge” (and unfortunately doesn’t appear to be a seasoned lawyer either). She is White.

**April C Wood** (age 49). Wood has been a lawyer for 15 years. She is currently on the court of appeals (since 2021 only). She was a district judge prior.  She believes she has “depth of judicial expertise.” She is White.

**Trey Allen** (age 47). Allen has been a lawyer for 22 years and is currently the general counsel for NC Administrative Office of the Courts. He is currently the top lawyer for the state court’s system. He says that he doesn’t live “activist judges” and that he will “follow the text and original understanding of the Constitution.” He is White.

&#x200B;

**NC Court of Appeals Judge Seat 9**

15 judges sit on Court of Appeals, but only 3 listen to any one case. Five are Democrats and 10 are Republicans.  They serve 8 year terms. The salary for this role is $135k.  The winner of this primary will face Democrat judge candidate Brad Salmon in the fall.

**Beth Freshwater Smith** (age 63). She has 34 years of legal experience and is a native North Carolinean. She was a former Senior Assistant DA and is currently a district court judge. She cites an extensive background in family law. She is White.

**Donna Stroud** (incumbent, age 58). She is currently the chief judge on the court of appeals. She has been on the court of appeals since 2007.  She is endorsed by pro-family groups like NC Values Coalition which supports “religious liberty” particularly in education. They describe her as a “strong conservative judge.” She is also an adjunct professor at Campbell Law School, her alma mater (where she says she graduated 1st in her class). She is White.

&#x200B;

**NC Court of Appeals Judge Seat 11**

This seat is currently held by a Democrat (Darren Jackson), and is the person the winner of this race will face in the fall. The two Republican challengers are:

**Michael J Stading** (approx. age 40). Stading lives in Mint Hill and is currently a district court judge. He has been a lawyer for 16 years. He is an Air Force reservist and former attorney for police officers. He is White.

**Charlton L Allen** (approx. age 50). Allen has been a lawyer 25 years and is currently a certified mediator. He says his role model is Antonin Scalia. He accuses his opponent (above) of switching parties but in a voter lookup on the board of elections site, it appears that is incorrect as Stading has voted as a Republican in the last 4 primaries dating back to 2012. Allen is White.

**NC State Senate District 42**

The winner of this race will face Democrat Rachel Hunt (who is uncontested) in the fall (note: this is actually Jeff Jackson’s old district). State senators receive a salary of $13,951 in addition to a per diem of $104.

(Separately, voters should know [10 of the 50 State Senate contests](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_State_Senate_elections,_2022) and [23 of the 120 House](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2022) contests are entirely uncontested. I will say that that doesn’t seem to be great for democracy. I hope the state political parties consider that in the future as the state legislature will be an incredibly important place to drive change on topics like technology and privacy laws in the future.)

**Cheryl Russo** (est age 51+). Russo has not held public office before. She is a very conservative Catholic cardiologist who says that she will fight for parental rights and Opportunity Scholarships to help low-income parents. There is little else about her that is publicly available and she hasn’t responded to interview requests from the Observer.  She is White.

**Scott Stone** (age 54). Stone is a businessman and civil engineer from South Charlotte. He was an NC House member from Mecklenburg County until he lost in 2018 when there was a “blue wave” in the county. He’s ambitious--he tried to run for mayor of Charlotte twice. His platform in this election is about reduced regulation and taxes, defending the constitution, avoiding government overreach, and prioritizing infrastructure investment. He believes few businesses can afford the current minimum wage so doesn’t support increasing it. In the past he has promoted more conservative issues in his previous campaigns like protecting the 2nd Amendment, enforcing voter ID laws and advocating against abortion but he seems to have toned down on the social issues for this campaign. He is endorsed by the Observer for the primary. He is White.

&#x200B;

**Mayor of Charlotte**

The Charlotte mayor receives $25,636 with an additional allowance (including auto) of $14,800.

**M. Moustafa** (age 63). He is the owner of a cab company and ran for city council more than 10 years ago. He is pro-immigration and says that is the issue where he differs most from the Republican party (he was educated in Egypt). He says he is “the voice of the everyday citizen.” The email that he registered to run is “egyplover at yahoo.”

**Stephanie de Sarachanga-Bilbao.** She is endorsed by the Charlotte Observer in spite of the fact that she failed to answer and rambled on basic questions like her age or if she disagreed with anything in the Republican party. She has a website where she has one photo of herself in a stylish leather jacket but says absolutely nothing about her positions or issues or explains why she is a Republican.  This is one of the Observer endorsements I do not agree with as there appears to be no useful information to even recommend her.

&#x200B;

**City Council at Large**

City Council members get paid $19,809 with expense allowances (including auto) of an additional $9,800. The Observer endorses Merrill, Leubke, Olinski and Mulligan. In reading the specific language on their websites, the candidates are quite moderate—some  are more centrist on social issues, others on economic issues.   It’s a far cry from the strident conservative language in the US Senate race. This is [an hour long video](https://www.tuesdayforumcharlotte.org/2022/04/26/4-candidates-in-gop-primary-for-city-council-at-large/) but has the candidates talk in their words.

**Kyle J Leubke** (age 32). Leubke is an openly gay Republican candidate and an attorney with a local firm. His parents sent him to conversion therapy as a teenager though he appears to have reconciled with his parents since. He says that his views are conservative even though he registered as a Democrat as recently as 2020. He is supported by one of the city council’s few Republicans, Tariq Bokhari. It’s unclear to me which of his positions align with Republicans as what he has said about his positions seem moderate to liberal (giving tax breaks to struggling homeowners, supporting public transportation). He was not in favor of the city’s 2040 plan that passed recently. He is White.

**David Merrill** (age 43). He seems to be moderate on social issues, suggesting that anti-gay or anti-abortion issues aren’t really things that he supports. The top issues on his site are public safety, affordable housing and economic mobility, including better public transportation. He was one of the youngest people to ever achieve the rank of Eagle Scout.  He is White.

**Charlie Mulligan** (age 33). The issues listed on his website are affordable housing, accountable policing, and making things easier for small businesses. He disagrees with the Republican party with respect to “how consenting adults should live their personal lives.” He also favors decriminalizing cannabis. He’s a graduate of UNC Charlotte and most recently has been at a startup in the alcohol space and was a former document filmmaker. He is White.

**Carrie Olinski** (age 38). Olinski is a physician’s assistant. She quotes Rosa Parks on her website and mentions issues like equitable healthcare, city insurance and safety as key issues. She does talk about being Christian so I suspect that she may lean more conservative on social issues though she appears to be moderate to liberal on economic issues. She is White and is the mother of a toddler girl.

**Mr David Michael Rice** (age 66). He has been a perennial on various ballots in Mecklenburg County in the past and does not appear to have won anything, nor to have the qualifications to serve in a public role. He says he is running because he “don’t have nothing better to do” since he is retired. He used to work in a drug store and had a presence on cable access TV. He has had [financial difficulties](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article170248332.html) in his past including liens and a bankruptcy. He is Black.",1651789161.0,CitizenProfane,"Election Summary Sheet: Republican Primary Candidates in South Charlotte Happy Cinco de Mayo!

This is my 4th election writeup since 2018; I had to split up the Republican and Democrat candidates because the list was too long.

Here is my summary of the Republican primary ballot. I added salary information where I could find it to this writeup. I thought some people may want to know how much taxpayers pay for each of these roles.

To see the writeup for the Democratic ballot, here it is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/uhvd27/election\_summary\_sheet\_whats\_on\_the\_democratic/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/uhvd27/election_summary_sheet_whats_on_the_democratic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Your specific ballot will likely be slightly different because of various local positions you will need to vote for. To find your ballot, it’s available here: [https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/)

Here are the positions and people on most of the Republican ballots in South Charlotte:

**US Senate**

This is for Richard Burr’s seat. US Senators receive a salary of $174k per year.There are even more Republicans running for this position than Democrats (it’s one of the most crowded races in decades).

A single candidate must win more than 30% of the votes in order to avoid a summer runoff (which would be the top 2 candidates). Hopefully one day there will be ranked choice voting.  Several of the candidates below are fringe contenders at best, with incomplete or nonexistent websites, no clear positions on key issues, and barely any money raised. The four leading contenders however are heavily financed with allegations of significant [dark money supporting their campaigns](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article261038787.html#subtopper).  In debates between McCrory, Eastman and Walker, they all are against student debt forgiveness, sending troops to Ukraine and teaching critical race theory in schools (Budd refused to attend the debates and Eastman didn’t qualify to be in the most recent debate.)

Here are the candidates:

**Pat McCrory** (1 of 2 frontrunners, age 65). McCrory was the mayor of predominantly Democratic Charlotte (from 1995-2009) and was the governor of North Carolina after that (from 2013-17). He was also a former longtime Duke Energy employee. The key issues he lists on his website are creating jobs and limiting taxes, investing in the military, supporting the police and approving conservative judges. McCrory has been endorsed by the Observer even though he “was a far different governor than after 7 terms as a moderate Charlotte mayor.” He did sign the notorious “bathroom bill” (HB2 which lost NC many business deals) into law in 2016. He claims that he balanced NC’s budget as governor (he cut programs like Medicaid and unemployment benefits when the NC legislature also had Republican majorities). At the same time, he did increase the education budget and teacher pay. There is some suspicion that he was involved in Duke Energy’s getting off easy on pollution and environmental issues like coal ash disposal. Both McCrory and Budd have raised about $4MM each (directly, not counting dark money) and both are White.

**Ted Budd** (1 of 2 frontrunners, age 51). Budd is a 2 term Congressman in what was a heavily gerrymandered district around the Greensboro area. He is also the owner of a gun range.  He is endorsed by Trump and did not appear in any of the Republican primary debates to the dismay of his opponents (only McCrory, Eastman and Walker have been in the debates).  He was also one of the Republicans who objected to the certification of the 2020 presidential election. His website says that he is a “liberal agenda crusher.”  The top issue listed on his website is Big Tech censorship and the “sanctity of life.” Protecting guns is 3rd issue listed. The rest of his topics are fairly standard conservative issues—parental freedom in education, integrity in elections, “stopping socialism,” etc. He and his wife homeschooled their children and he met his wife on a mission trip. He graduated from App State and has an MBA from Wake Forest.  He has supposedly been supported by $8MM+ additional campaign funds through dark money groups.

**Marjorie K Eastman** (age 43).  Eastman and her husband are both military veterans (she served in Afghanistan). She appears to be a motivational speaker and author now. Her school age son is a cancer (neuroblastoma) survivor. She says she believes in term limits and wants to return “to the Reagan era” (free enterprise, peace). She says that “defunding the police is one of the most idiotic ideas to come from the far left.” She supports most traditional conservative positions like a strong military, low taxes, individual rights and education, but she also supports “conserving the environment.”  She also believes that China and the US are “at odds.” She is from Wake Forest, NC. She is the 3rd most funded Republican candidate and is White.

**David Flaherty** (age 69).  He is a retired citizen (seemingly a former lawyer) and believes the government spends “way too much” and that more restrictions on law-abiding citizens are a bad idea. He’s run for statehouse offices before (district court judge, district attorney). He appears to be from a small town between Raleigh and Fayetteville.

**Benjamin E Griffiths.** He did post on his Facebook page “the real fix to Congress is TERM LIMITS” (sic). There is very little available about him otherwise. His Facebook page has 27 followers. He appears to be White.

**Kenneth Harper Jr**. Harper calls himself a “rational conservative.” He was a teen father just after high school and then became a small store owner and eventually a car salesman. He talks a lot in his bio about his financial troubles in life.  He lists very little of his platform other than “affordable healthcare” and “protecting the lives of the unborn.” He is the father of three grown women and is Black.

**Charles Kenneth Moss** (age 82). He is an evangelist preacher and has run for Governor twice before. He has considered himself a “moderate conservative” (at least from an interview in 2016, as there is very little that is available about him now).

**Lichia Sibhatu** (age 65). Sibhatu was born in Eritrea and is currently a daycare owner. She lists “diversity” as one of the top things on her website. She is Black.

**Debora Tshiovo** (est age early 20s). Tshiovo calls herself a conservative Christian. She attended the University of Maryland and makes no mention of any North Carolina ties. Many of the issues she lists on her website like prison reform and national security are blank. She does however have a paragraph about abortion. She is Black.

**Mark Walker** (age 52). Walker is a former pastor and is now a Congressman for a district in the Greensboro area. He claims that he doesn’t engage in mudslinging. The top issues listed on his site are saving taxpayers money, combatting sexual assault and human trafficking, and a balanced budget amendment. Like Eastman, he mentions being anti-China on his website. He mentions little to nothing about the environment on his site. Walker is just behind Eastman in fundraising (and far behind McCrory and Budd). He is the father of three and White.

**Jen Banwart** (age 45). She worked for many years at the Department of Defense and has a background in counterterrorism. She lives in the Raleigh area and is very anti-big government. She says that the way to fight inflation is to reduce the size of the federal government. She also believes that the private sector has the best solutions for climate change. Interestingly her website seems to suggest that “politics of individualism” and issues like abortion are “tertiary” for her. She is White.

**Ms. Lee A Brian** (age 38). She is currently a charter bus driver. She has run for a house seat in the past and was a write-in candidate against Thom Tillis. She says that if Roe is overturned that she would create a bill that “states life begins at conception regardless of how the child was conceived.”  She also believes in term limits. There appear to be no photos of her online and she doesn’t have any endorsements. She has bizarre links to “white hat websites” on her site.

**Leonard L Bryant** (age 53). He was a veteran in the military for most of his career (several decades). His platform is vague but he wants to “protect the Constitution on a federal level,” “stand for conservative values,” and stop the censoring of conservatives. He believes critical race theory censors conservatives. He is Black.

**Drew Bulecza** (age 59). He is a salesman and horse breeder. He appears to be a far right candidate. He believes that wind mills are a scam and solar panels are insufficient. He wants to abolish Planned Parenthood and arm more citizens to reduce violent crime. He is White.

&#x200B;

**US House District 14**

This is a new district which the Cook Report describes as “solid Democrat.” Congressmen, like Senators, receive $174k per year as salary.

**Pat Harrigan** (age 35). Harrigan is a former Green Beret and graduate of West Point. He does support renewable energy as a source of jobs and managing climate control. He says defunding the police is not an option and that voter IDs should exist.  It is unclear if Harrigan resides in District 14 (though that isn’t a requirement for running). His address listed with the board of elections is in Hickory, NC. He is White.

**Jonathan Simpson** (age 33). Simpson is a veteran and a businessman but has no prior public service experience. His website cites school choice and a “pro-growth tax code” as his top issues. He also does cite environmental issues as a concern (his site is selling t-shirts that say “go green-go nuclear”).  He is endorsed by the Observer in the primary. He is White.

&#x200B;

**NC Supreme Court Associate Justice Seat 5**

Judgeships comprise a significant part of the ballot (and will be even bigger in November). These positions below are all state court judges, starting with the highest level: the NC State Supreme Court, followed by Appellate Courts. The act of judges listing their political affiliation on the ballot started relatively recently in 2017.

There are 7 State Supreme Court judges who get 8 year terms. The salary is $156k.

**Victoria E Prince** (approx. age late 20s). She was only admitted to the bar in 2019 and is an attorney in private practice. She admits that she is not “a seasoned judge” (and unfortunately doesn’t appear to be a seasoned lawyer either). She is White.

**April C Wood** (age 49). Wood has been a lawyer for 15 years. She is currently on the court of appeals (since 2021 only). She was a district judge prior.  She believes she has “depth of judicial expertise.” She is White.

**Trey Allen** (age 47). Allen has been a lawyer for 22 years and is currently the general counsel for NC Administrative Office of the Courts. He is currently the top lawyer for the state court’s system. He says that he doesn’t live “activist judges” and that he will “follow the text and original understanding of the Constitution.” He is White.

&#x200B;

**NC Court of Appeals Judge Seat 9**

15 judges sit on Court of Appeals, but only 3 listen to any one case. Five are Democrats and 10 are Republicans.  They serve 8 year terms. The salary for this role is $135k.  The winner of this primary will face Democrat judge candidate Brad Salmon in the fall.

**Beth Freshwater Smith** (age 63). She has 34 years of legal experience and is a native North Carolinean. She was a former Senior Assistant DA and is currently a district court judge. She cites an extensive background in family law. She is White.

**Donna Stroud** (incumbent, age 58). She is currently the chief judge on the court of appeals. She has been on the court of appeals since 2007.  She is endorsed by pro-family groups like NC Values Coalition which supports “religious liberty” particularly in education. They describe her as a “strong conservative judge.” She is also an adjunct professor at Campbell Law School, her alma mater (where she says she graduated 1st in her class). She is White.

&#x200B;

**NC Court of Appeals Judge Seat 11**

This seat is currently held by a Democrat (Darren Jackson), and is the person the winner of this race will face in the fall. The two Republican challengers are:

**Michael J Stading** (approx. age 40). Stading lives in Mint Hill and is currently a district court judge. He has been a lawyer for 16 years. He is an Air Force reservist and former attorney for police officers. He is White.

**Charlton L Allen** (approx. age 50). Allen has been a lawyer 25 years and is currently a certified mediator. He says his role model is Antonin Scalia. He accuses his opponent (above) of switching parties but in a voter lookup on the board of elections site, it appears that is incorrect as Stading has voted as a Republican in the last 4 primaries dating back to 2012. Allen is White.

&#x200B;

**NC State Senate District 42**

The winner of this race will face Democrat Rachel Hunt (who is uncontested) in the fall (note: this is actually Jeff Jackson’s old district). State senators receive a salary of $13,951 in addition to a per diem of $104.

(Separately, voters should know [10 of the 50 State Senate contests](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_State_Senate_elections,_2022) and [23 of the 120 House](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2022) contests are entirely uncontested. I will say that that doesn’t seem to be great for democracy. I hope the state political parties consider that in the future as the state legislature will be an incredibly important place to drive change on topics like technology and privacy laws in the future.)

**Cheryl Russo** (est age 51+). Russo has not held public office before. She is a very conservative Catholic cardiologist who says that she will fight for parental rights and Opportunity Scholarships to help low-income parents. There is little else about her that is publicly available and she hasn’t responded to interview requests from the Observer.  She is White.

Charlotte Proposed 2022 Budget,"Charlotte arts funding change added to proposed budget. CMPD, housing get boosts too


Charlotte leaders took a major step toward in severing ties with the Arts & Science Council on Monday, with the city’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2022 instead earmarking millions of dollars to the Foundation For the Carolinas to dole out grants.

The $4 million from the city’s general fund — plus $2 million from the federal American Rescue Plan — is a temporary approach.

The City Council is contemplating a longer-term strategy to support arts groups across Charlotte, all while bucking a decades-long model of relying on the ASC as a pass-through funding agency. Mecklenburg County is not expected to follow suit, with commissioners last week voicing strong support for the ASC and its recent focus on racial equity.

The private sector would match the city’s arts and culture contribution, for a joint total of $36 million over three years, said City Manager Marcus Jones. Five companies already have pledged a combined $7.2 million, the foundation said Monday.

In the new fiscal year, Jones said, ASC would receive $800,000.

NO PROPERTY TAX HIKE FOR CHARLOTTE

Despite the controversy over the arts plan, it’s all still a small sliver of the $2.7-billion budget Jones outlined on Monday to City Council members, who will vote on adopting it in June. That’s a roughly 6% increase, and the city’s general fund will grow by 4.4%, to $750.7 million.

There’s no property tax increase under Jones’ proposal, and the city would not need to dip into any rainy day reserve funds.

Compared to last year’s budget, Jones likened this iteration to “Resilience and Recovery: Volume 2.”

Mayor Vi Lyles said the budget is about “building community and making a difference in the lives of our residents.” She said more discussion is needed about the ASC.

Major funding allocations will help the city reach its sustainability goals, build new fire stations and complete the Cross Charlotte Trail, a trail and greenway spanning more than 30 miles.

The budget also doesn’t incorporate any new federal COVID-19 relief money, even though the City Council just received its first tranche of about $74.5 million from the American Rescue Plan.

Jones said he is collaborating with Mecklenburg County and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools leaders on the best way to deploy its total allotment of $682 million. County Manager Dena Dioro will present her proposed budget Thursday morning.

Here’s a closer look at the city’s incoming budget.

FEE INCREASES

▪ Households can expect their Charlotte Water fee to increase by $2.33 per month.

▪ The Storm Water Services fee will increase by 29 cents per month for households.

▪ The property tax will stay at 34.81 cents for $100 of assessed value, or about $750 for the average Charlotte household.

▪ There’s no fare increase for the Charlotte Area Transit System.

CMPD

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department could get a 3.7% budget increase, under Jones’ recommendation. That’s primarily targeted for police officer salary increases and benefits, though Jones said the city is also committed to its work of reimagining CMPD and curbing violent crime through allocating $3.2 million for community-oriented programs.

With a nearly $740,00 funding increase, the number of CMPD Community Policing Crisis Response Teams — designed to handle mental and behavioral health emergencies — could double, Jones said.

The city will also allocate $1.2 million to launch a mental health civilian response initiative, similar to the lauded CAHOOTS intervention program in Eugene, Oregon, which dispatches crisis workers instead of traditional law enforcement officers.

During last year’s budget discussion, City Council member Braxton Winston drew sharp scrutiny of CMPD’s budget, comprising roughly 40% of Charlotte’s general fund. It came in the aftermath of a startling George Floyd protest in uptown, where CMPD cornered peaceful demonstrators on Fourth Street.

Winston successfully led a community push barring police officials from buying chemical agents.

Still, in this year’s proposed budget, CMPD would get $300.9 million — or 40.1% of the city’s general fund.

CITY EMPLOYEES

There are no planned layoffs, and city employees will get a 3% salary increase.

Charlotte is also raising the salaries of the city’s lowest-paid employees from $33,280 to $38,090, which is 60% of Charlotte’s median household income. The change impacts nearly 150 people. The goal, Jones said, is to ensure people in core services like the Charlotte Department of Transportation and Charlotte Water can afford to live in the city.

Police and firefighter will also get raises, finishing off a three-year program to reach top pay, Jones said.

UPCOMING BONDS

Jones recommended investing $50 million for sidewalks, with $10 million earmarked for suburban areas in a 2022 bond.

The city would issue another $50-million bond for affordable housing, plus $10 million to ease traffic congestion in areas including south Charlotte, Steele Creek and University City.

OPPORTUNITY CORRIDORS

A hallmark of last year’s budget was the city’s $24.5-million investment in so-called “opportunity corridors,” including economic developments in neighborhoods along Beatties Ford Road and West Boulevard.

Planning is underway to start progress on the city’s remaining two corridors, along North Tryon/Graham streets and Freedom Drive/Wilkinson Boulevard, Jones said.

In this year’s budget, Jones said, the city will invest $14 million in opportunity corridors. That involves $7 million for housing and “neighborhood stabilization” efforts, plus $7 million jobs and economic development. The city will unveil new “aging in place” pilot programs this year for senior citizens, too, Jones said.

“We believe there’s an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs throughout the city and throughout the region,” Jones said.

NEXT STEPS

The City Council business meeting on May 10 will feature a budget public hearing.

You can sign up to speak online at Charlottenc.gov/CityClerk/Pages/Speak.aspx. Reach the city clerk at 704-336-2248 or cityclerk@charlottenc.gov.

Council members will cast straw votes on May 26, before officially adopting the budget on June 14.

This is where you decide who wins prizes for posts or comments you liked in the past year. The winners win awards and are immortalized in the /r/Bestof2021 sub.

This nomination thread will stay stickied (as long as nothing else replaces it) until early next year, when the admins award the coins to give out the awards.

**How to vote:**
Post a nomination under this thread. A link to the post is required, and if you want you can add a short explanation as to why you nominated it. 

Only post nominations as a top level comment. You can chat under the nomination itself if you would like.

Possible things to be on the lookout for include:

- Most Unusual
- Most Obscure
- Most Informative Rebuttal
- Best Review
- Funniest Post
- Funniest Comment

**Prizes**: We have at least 36,000 coins (20 mod awards) to spend on rewards this year.  It's very likely we'll be able to award the majority of the nominations, based on previous year's participation.

Voting will remain open till the admins hand out the coins, and the winners will be announced and their prizes awarded in early 2022. Good luck!

My list of reasons to move to Charlotte,"Charlotte, North Carolina is slowly growing in popularity as more and more people decide to move to the area. It doesn’t matter whether you are single, part of a couple or moving as a family – the area boasts of features that make it one of the best places to settle down. So what exactly can residents brag about Charlotte, NC? Here is a list:

**Melting Pot**

The best thing about Charlotte: the fact that no one who lives here is actually from Charlotte. The city is home to thousands of people who came from different parts of the country and even the world. The lack of a solid culture is actually a good thing because it turns into an excellent melting pot of any race and age. As a result, you will find yourself meeting all kinds of people, exposed to all kinds of food and essentially enjoying all kinds of activities and pleasure not limited to just a specific region.

**Weather**

The weather is perfect! All four seasons are experienced in Charlotte, but not in extensive levels. During summer, the weather is not incredibly hot and during winter, there is enough snow to enjoy the season without obliterating too much of the road. Spring and fall are, of course, equally present and actually beautiful considering how Charlotte is still home to lots of trees and plants. Whether you live in the actual city or a little farther from the center, you will be able to enjoy the changing colors of the leaves as the season changes from one to the next.

**Traffic is Non-Existent**

Traffic is an ever-increasing problem that seems to be existent in every major city. If you are tired with all the traffic, however, Charlotte will be able to give you the kind of drive that affords leisure and comfort. No need to worry about an hour-long drive just to get some groceries since the roads here are far from congested. In fact, depending on where you live, it is perfectly possible to just walk to places for supplies.

**Jobs**

Charlotte is a banking capital, but don’t imagine it to be one of those strait-laced cities where everyone rushes from one place to other wearing suits. Beyond the banking center, the people of the city are pretty laid-backed and enjoy the kind of life quality in New York but without all the drawbacks. If you are thinking about moving to Charlotte, then you will be glad to know that there are lots of jobs to go around, ensuring that you will find a means of support when you finally move here.

**The Beer**

Charlotte boasts of home-brewed beers unlike anything else you will find in the country. Sure, popular bars carry all kinds of beer – even the ones that you have gotten used to in your old watering hole. Additional brands are available, however, and if you will just try one of them, you will find that the home-grown drinks are better – and taste more of Charlotte.

**Active Outdoors**

There are around 10 mountains nearby and tons of outdoor activities to keep you in shape. Hiking trails, mountain climbing, biking trails, and even chasing the white rapids are available in Charlotte. The Rapids are a favorite for many, especially since the US National Whitewater Center is located nearby. It offers a perfect simulation of whitewater rafting minus all the possible dangers and problems you will encounter in the actual scenery.

**NASCAR**

Not everyone is a fan of NASCAR but if you are, then you will be glad to know that Charlotte is NASCAR heaven. Also, if you are not content with just watching the race – you can actually participate in it – or at least, gain some experience. There are some services that let you enjoy a few laps for a fee.

**Food, Glorious Food**

The fact that Charlotte is a melting pot of so many culture means that you will be able to find all sorts of food in their restaurants. Asian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, and more – it doesn’t matter what kind of food you prefer because you will find them all in Charlotte. There are also restaurants strictly for the vegetarians or vegans so the place welcomes practically anyone with varied dietary preferences.

**Market and Relaxation**

Residents of Charlotte always look forward to the first Friday of the month because this is when all kinds of food trucks come over for a city-wide fiesta. There are morning markets and farmer markets, both of which sell some of the freshest and most affordable food items that you can’t get anywhere else. Of course, that doesn’t mean the market is limited to those days. The fact is that they are open all year round, featuring a strip of stalls and cafes that serve all kinds of food for your pleasure. It is easy to eat healthy here as well as live healthy, especially with all the spas and services designed to help you relax.

**Nightlife**

For the singles out there thinking about moving to Charlotte, look forward to an excellent nightlife but without the usual danger that comes from living in the big city. Charlotte is host to some of the most active yet safe bars which can be packed every Friday and Saturday night. No worries if you are hoping to meet that special someone in Charlotte – the city is home to lots of singles so you can definitely find some action here.

**Family Facilities**

Of course, those who are moving to the city together with their kids will be happy to know that Charlotte is incredibly welcoming to families. The real estate prices here are within reasonable range and the children will benefit from the near-quiet lifestyle of the neighborhood. There are also lots of schools for elementary and high school students, each one featuring an excellent education system. For college students, there is the University of North Carolina which is one of the most prestigious schools out there.

**Pet Friendly**

Another fact residents love is how Charlotte welcomes every member of your family – even the four-legged kind. There are parks, bakeries, and even bars for dogs and tons of services meant to keep your family pet happy.

I hope you enjoyed the article. Please consider us to help your next move go smoothly in Charlotte.

Whether you live in the actual city or a little farther from the center, you will be able to enjoy the changing colors of the leaves as the season changes from one to the next.

**Traffic is Non-Existent**

Traffic is an ever-increasing problem that seems to be existent in every major city. If you are tired with all the traffic, however, Charlotte will be able to give you the kind of drive that affords leisure and comfort. No need to worry about an hour-long drive just to get some groceries since the roads here are far from congested. In fact, depending on where you live, it is perfectly possible to just walk to places for supplies.

**Jobs**

Charlotte is a banking capital, but don’t imagine it to be one of those strait-laced cities where everyone rushes from one place to other wearing suits. Beyond the banking center, the people of the city are pretty laid-backed and enjoy the kind of life quality in New York but without all the drawbacks. If you are thinking about moving to Charlotte, then you will be glad to know that there are lots of jobs to go around, ensuring that you will find a means of support when you finally move here.

**The Beer**

Charlotte boasts of home-brewed beers unlike anything else you will find in the country. Sure, popular bars carry all kinds of beer – even the ones that you have gotten used to in your old watering hole. Additional brands are available, however, and if you will just try one of them, you will find that the home-grown drinks are better – and taste more of Charlotte.

**Active Outdoors**

There are around 10 mountains nearby and tons of outdoor activities to keep you in shape. Hiking trails, mountain climbing, biking trails, and even chasing the white rapids are available in Charlotte. The Rapids are a favorite for many, especially since the US National Whitewater Center is located nearby. It offers a perfect simulation of whitewater rafting minus all the possible dangers and problems you will encounter in the actual scenery.

**NASCAR**

Not everyone is a fan of NASCAR but if you are, then you will be glad to know that Charlotte is NASCAR heaven. Also, if you are not content with just watching the race – you can actually participate in it – or at least, gain some experience. There are some services that let you enjoy a few laps for a fee.

**Food, Glorious Food**

The fact that Charlotte is a melting pot of so many culture means that you will be able to find all sorts of food in their restaurants. Asian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, and more – it doesn’t matter what kind of food you prefer because you will find them all in Charlotte. There are also restaurants strictly for the vegetarians or vegans so the place welcomes practically anyone with varied dietary preferences.

**Market and Relaxation**

Residents of Charlotte always look forward to the first Friday of the month because this is when all kinds of food trucks come over for a city-wide fiesta. There are morning markets and farmer markets, both of which sell some of the freshest and most affordable food items that you can’t get anywhere else. Of course, that doesn’t mean the market is limited to those days. The fact is that they are open all year round, featuring a strip of stalls and cafes that serve all kinds of food for your pleasure. It is easy to eat healthy here as well as live healthy, especially with all the spas and services designed to help you relax.

**Nightlife**

For the singles out there thinking about moving to Charlotte, look forward to an excellent nightlife but without the usual danger that comes from living in the big city. Charlotte is host to some of the most active yet safe bars which can be packed every Friday and Saturday night. No worries if you are hoping to meet that special someone in Charlotte – the city is home to lots of singles so you can definitely find some action here.

**Family Facilities**

Of course, those who are moving to the city together with their kids will be happy to know that Charlotte is incredibly welcoming to families. The real estate prices here are within reasonable range and the children will benefit from the near-quiet lifestyle of the neighborhood. There are also lots of schools for elementary and high school students, each one featuring an excellent education system. For college students, there is the University of North Carolina which is one of the most prestigious schools out there.

**Pet Friendly**

Another fact residents love is how Charlotte welcomes every member of your family – even the four-legged kind. There are parks, bakeries, and even bars for dogs and tons of services meant to keep your family pet happy.

I hope you enjoyed the article. Please consider us to help your next move go smoothly in Charlotte.

r/Charlotte has Adopted a stream!,"Hey guys, 

I posted a while back about us adopting a stream to clean up in the area. Well, I have officially filled out the paperwork, and we are just two cleanups away from getting our own r/Charlotte signs on a local waterway.

I chose the section of Toby Creek behind the University City Target. 

We can do our first clean up as soon as ~~THIS WEEKEND~~ **edit: looks like Sunday June 4th is a good morning, with a post-cleanup celebration at Flying Saucer.** If you are interested please respond and/or fill out this doodle poll, and I will update with the official meet up time to come out and clean the stream! Waders, gloves, trashbags all provided - and perhaps after we could all grab a beer nearby.

We can always adjust times as needed, just threw out a morning and evening time slot as a suggestion.

Any good places to fly a drone in/around Charlotte?,"Thinking about buying a drone (DJI FPV). I live smack dab in the middle of Uptown though. So I’m not sure how far out from the city center I’d have to go to be able to fly and have a decent experience.

immediate neighbors are loud and inconsiderate; playing music until 2am,"We just moved to the university area from south park due to commuting times. This is our first Saturday at the new place. Because so many of the rentals around north Charlotte were getting taken so quickly, I didn’t have time to do my usual “check out at night and on the weekends”. 

It is now Saturday night and there was some type of domestic disagreement which ended with the girlfriend getting picked up by her friends and her friends yelling at the guy for almost 2 hours (from midnight -1am) and now, 2am, a neighbor within the complex playing loud music with the base turned all the way up in a presumably  huge ass truck/suv

I really don’t want to ruffle feathers and call for noise ordinance, but this music is ridiculous and quite literally the base is impossible to drown out. I don’t know if everyone else is used to it and deals? Should I just let it be just today and let it slide? I don’t want a target on my back for calling someone.

Edit: music finally stopped at 245am. I didn’t call but I did try 311 and it was really difficult to get through/speak to an operator so I gave up

Edit2: some of y’all read “university” and automatically think rowdy college kids are in every neighborhood. I’m in a townhouse community with an HOA, most if not all are above college age.

Election Summary Sheet: Here are all the candidates on the Republican and Democratic Ballots for Charlotte Voters,"I've been doing this for the last 3 elections and people tell me it's useful so here it goes again. There are a LOT of candidates in this upcoming primary. I did my best to provide a summary of most of them (I omitted the presidential candidates, and the board members representing specific districts). I start with the Republican ballot. You must scroll way down for for the Democratic ballot. Independents can choose which primary they want to vote in.  If you have comments or additional information to inform voters, please add them at the bottom.  Be informed and vote!  

**Here’s what is on the Republican ballot.**

I won’t go into detail on the presidential candidates though it is important to note that there are two serious candidates against Trump. **Bill Weld** was the former governor of Massachusetts and **Joe Walsh** is a vocal former congressman who feels that Republicans should get another choice. 

**US Senate candidates:** 

**Thom Tillis.** Tillis is the incumbent first elected in 2014 (who will likely have a tough race in November but should sail through the primary). He stayed within party lines and has supported Trump and has advocated anti-abortion issues and some anti-Internet marketplace actions (e.g. anti-counterfeit measures, the SANTA Act which forces more accountability on the part of marketplace sellers). He calls himself a “common sense fiscal conservative.” He is a critic of tax increases and “passionate about serving active military members, veterans and their families.” He supported Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and “the President’s stance on border security.” Tillis was previously speaker of the NC House. In the House, he supported the 2nd Amendment, anti-abortion initiatives and voter ID efforts. He lives in Huntersville.

**Paul Wright**. Wright was a former judge (District Court judge, Superior Court Judge). Wright, like his name, leans right. He has a “lifelong interest in conservative politics.” He believes “Christianity should be rightfully restored to its proper place to protect the rights of the people.” He is worried about dechristianization (“America losing its soul”), supports the 2nd Amendment and the right to bear arms, supports building a border wall and ending sanctuary cities, and wants to reverse same-sex marriage. 

**Larry Holmquist.** Holmquist claims to be a “consistent conservative” and is a far-right candidate. He is pro-wall and 2nd amendment, anti-abortion (he thinks Planned Parenthood is “despicable”), pro term limits (thinks both Senators and House reps should have 12 years only), anti-Obamacare and pro strong national defense. He is “disgusted by Thom Tillis’ ‘flip-flopping’” and asserts that Thom Tillis is opposed to Trump’s border wall.  He is a supporter of energy companies (“over-zealous environmentalists” should not be allowed to “shackle the country’s energy output.”) He also wants to abolish federal education standards and let cities and counties determine education. He is from the Midwest (Illinios and Iowa), lives in Greensboro, and is a former salesman and businessman. 

**Sharon Hudson.** Hudson is a graduate of UNCC, lives in the Charlotte area and appears to be a moderate candidate. She is anti-Thom Tillis because she didn’t like the I-77 toll road expansion which she thinks he pushed. She believes these “failing financial models shouldn’t be forced on the American people.” She is pro-environment (though doesn’t mention anything specific to save it). She believes illegal immigrants should have “a strong guest worker program.” She is pro-life and supports “charter schools, private schools and homeschooling.” Her father was a cousin of Chuck Yeager (she’s from West Virginia where Yeager is from; Yeager was the first pilot to break the sound barrier). 

**NC Governor:**

**Dan Forest.** Forest is an architect by training. He served for two terms as the Lieutenant Governor (2 terms max is what the NC Constitution allows). He is also a very conservative candidate: he supports school choice, was pro HB2, has voted against climate change legislation and is anti-gun control.  He is as close to political royalty in Charlotte as one gets: he is the son of Sue Myrick, the Congresswoman from District 9 from 1995-2013 and former Charlotte mayor.  Forest is in the midst of a money scandal because he recently received an in-kind donation from a donor who was indicted for financial crimes. 

**Holly Grange.**  Grange has a sparse website but decent experience; “Trump supporter” is one of the few words on her homepage. She is a “wife, mother, military veteran and member of NC House or Representatives.” She went to West Point. Her plan under “jobs & economy” on her website says that she supports tort reform to crackdown on trial lawyers and “jackpot justice.” She wants sheriffs to cooperate with ICE (unlike Mecklenburg Country’s sheriff). She is pro-life, pro-veteran and pro first responders (police and firefighters). She lives in Wilmington. 

**NC Lieutenant Governor:** 

This is an understandably less scrutinized race than governor as the role has less responsibility (even though the salary, $125k, is almost as much as the Governor’s). This role is like the Vice President: it is 2nd in line to the governorship, and it presides over the NC Senate. The role also serves on the NC Board of Education, the NC Capital Planning Commission, the NC Board of Community Colleges and is Chairman of eLearning Commission.  I’m not sure why there are as many candidates as there are though [this article explains it](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article238269133.html): many believe it is a stepping stone, a “cushy” job with a good title and relatively little attention.  

**John Ritter.** Ritter is a lawyer in Moore County and a new father. It does not appear that he has any political experience. He is an advocate of vocational education, strong infrastructure, and fiscal responsibility. 

**Mark Robinson.** Robinson has little political experience. He served in the Army reserves and held a number of different jobs as a factory and restaurant shift worker. He gave an impassioned speech about the right for citizens to own guns to the Greensboro City Council in April 2018 which made its way to YouTube and was well-received by conservatives as he critiqued the “loonies on the left.” He is also African American, which makes him a unique and appealing spokesperson for conservatives. 

**Scott Stone.** Stone is a businessman and civil engineer from South Charlotte. He was an NC House member from Mecklenburg County until he lost in 2018 when there was a “blue wave” in the county. He’s ambitious--he tried to run for mayor of Charlotte twice. His platform in this election is about reduced regulation and taxes, standing up to sanctuary sheriffs, protecting the 2nd Amendment and enforcing voter ID laws and advocating against abortion.

**Andy Wells.** Wells is currently an NC State Senator for a rural area near Winston-Salem. He was an NC House member before that. He is a business owner of a real estate development company and his website indicates he is supportive of voter ID laws and not supportive of sanctuary sheriffs. 

**Buddy Bengal.** Bengal is a young entrepreneur in New Bern with restaurants, a small baseball team and a syrup company to his name. He is an advocate of job creation and economic development and believes he can be a “salesman for the state.” He also mentions accountability for public employees but it’s unclear what that means other than to “reorganize inefficient or bloated departments.” 

**Deborah Cochran.** Cochran is a former mayor of Mt Airy and teacher at a local high school. She says that she is an advocate of teachers. Her website states nothing specific about her issues other than esoteric statements like “I want to be the voice for all of NC.” While mayor, she says she led on the following issues: “responsible governance, lowering property tax rates, and public safety as necessities for citizens.”

**Renee Ellmers.** Ellmers was a US House Representative for the 2nd District of NC (which include Raleigh) from 2011 to 2017. Ellmers was a nurse elected to office in the Tea Party wave of 2010.  She lost the GOP primary in 2016 amid allegations that she had an affair with Kevin McCarthy, the US House Minority Leader. She has been accused of being not conservative enough (she, with other Republican women, tried to stop a vote on banning abortions after 20 weeks—she disagreed with some of the rape provisions). In fact, others in the Republican party have accused her of being a RINO (Republican In Name Only). 

**Greg Gebhardt.** Gebhardt is a military veteran and was an author of the NC voter ID law. His platform includes enforcing “common-sense legislation that enforces immigration laws,” advocating against abortion, defending the 2nd Amendment and “fighting socialism.” Healthcare and education are listed last on his platform page. 

**Mark Johnson.** Johnson is currently the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He says he is running to “fight complacency in state government.” As superintendent, he was against the Common Core and that got him into many fights with what he called “bureaucratic fiefdoms” and the “deep state.” He was caught in controversy for awarding an $8MM computer-based testing solution when an advisory committee said otherwise, and for monitoring an employee’s text messages illegally. He was also accused of purchasing $6MM in iPads that didn’t follow protocol and happened after a trip to Apple’s headquarters in Silicon Valley. 

**NC Attorney General:**

The NC Attorney General is the top law enforcement officer and top lawyer of the state. According to the NC Department of Justice website, “the Attorney General oversees criminal appeals from state courts to ensure that criminals are kept behind bars and innocent people are not. \[The role\] also ensures that consumers are protected by going after scam artists and corporate bad actors. The Attorney General protects the taxpayers as well, by providing legal representation to state government agencies, departments and commissions, and by investigating and cracking down on Medicaid fraud.”

**Jim O’Neill.** O’Neill served as Forsyth County District Attorney since 2009. He ran for NC District Attorney in 2016 and lost the primary (the role is currently held by a Democrat). He says he will address the backlog of sexual assault kits that are with the state, support federal immigration policy (he supports ICE) and not support sanctuary cities, and will fight the opioid crisis. He is also an advocate of the death penalty. 

**Sam Hayes.** Hayes is a conservative candidate who has served as the general counsel for a number of state level positions. His website mentions the importance of enforcing voter ID laws, the 2nd amendment and a number of other conservative issues. 

**Christine Mumma.** Mumma is a career lawyer and says she is conservative. She says she believes in “the sanctity of life” and is the Executive Director of the NC Center on Actual Innocence where she represented and exonerated 9 men who were wrongfully convicted. O’Neill has aired some attack ads claiming that some of Mumma’s clients were in fact guilty. 

**NC Auditor:**

This position performs audits for state governments. Some of the CPAs applying for Treasurer would probably be better suited for this role. 

**Anthony (Tony) Street**. Street is from Brunswick County and has worked in nuclear security and commercial fishing and has operated a small business. He has a master’s in public administration from UNC Pembroke. He says he wants ensure voters know how their money is spent but I’m not sure he has the accounting qualifications to execute this role. 

**Tim Hoegemeyer.** This candidate served in the military and also has an MPA (from NC State). He has been the general counsel to the Office of the State Auditor (though he’s not listed in the NC Auditor’s website as a staff member, presumably because he recently gave notice to run for this role). He has said that he wants to proactively seek out fraud and waste versus just responding to hotline tips.  

**NC Commissioner of Insurance:**

This role regulates the insurance industry in North Carolina, licenses insurance professionals, educations customers about insurance and handles customer complaints about insurance.  The salary is $125k

**Ronald Pierce.** Pierce ran in the last primary for this role in 2016 and appears to have an ax to grind because he believes that Wayne Goodwin (former Insurance Commissioner wrongfully accused him of crimes). On the homepage of his website, he says he believes that the current incumbent (Mike Causey) has “done nothing substantial to correct the situation.” The situation in question is that Goodwin (now the current Chair of the NC Democratic Party) had Pierce arrested on 108 fraud charges in 2014 though Pierce insists they are “false charges.” The charges were ultimately dismissed. Pierce believes that this division of government should support consumers not insurance companies. He also wants to reduce conflicts of interest (eg any employee must wait 3 years before being employed by, say, an insurance company). 

**Mike Causey.** Causey is the incumbent and the State Fire Marshal. He’s an Army veteran and worked in the insurance industry for 25 years. His website says his “goal as commissioner is to fight for more competition in the industry and to combat insurance fraud to drive rates lower for the North Carolina consumer.  He is also passionate about making the office more consumer-friendly to help residents attain their insurance needs.” Causey is currently embroiled in the same scandal as Dan Forest who is accused of accepting funds from a wealthy donor who is now accused of bribery. Causey was evidently an FBI informant in that case. (Hat’s off to the Charlotte Observer for great reporting on this issue—long live local journalism.) 

**NC Commissioner of Labor.** 

I’m fascinated by this position because it replaces Cherie Berry! You know, the woman whose photo is on every elevator in NC (she’s evidently been in that role for two decades). Berry has had a reputation of being soft on employers who violate labor laws. This position also does a number of other important as well things like inspect amusement park rides and investigate employment discrimination. 

**Chuck Stanley.** There is little information online about Stanley. He doesn’t appear to have a website, nor are there photos that appear on any election related sites. 

**Josh Dobson.** Dobson is currently a state representative and also a former county commissioner.  He appears to have raised more money in this race than his opponents. He also doesn’t think this role should be “on a crusade” to prosecute businesses. He has the endorsement of NC Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler and NC Congressman Mark Meadows.  

**Pearl Burris Floyd.** Floyd has served in a number of government roles (State Representative, Gaston County Commissioner). Floyd has Berry’s endorsement and says has firsthand experience with workplace safety issues working as a lab safety officer. She is also on the UNC Board of Governors and an African-American woman in the Republican party.

**NC Secretary of State:**

This role is the head the economic and business-related operations of the state. 

**EC Sykes.** Sykes says he wants to help NC by “bringing transparency and efficiency to our state government with commonsense policies like honoring the rule of law, cutting waste, limiting the size of government, and restoring citizens’ confidence in our government.” His homepage announces that he is “a man of strong faith.” He was a former Ted Cruz campaign volunteer. He does not appear to have any political background but does have a business background. 

**Chad Brown.** Brown is the current Gaston County Commissioner. His website says he is pro 2nd Amendment, pro-life and that he promotes transparency. Below those values, he outlines his positions and accomplishments as county commissioner: in particular, he introduced a small business tax credit. He wants people to know that NC is “open for business.”

**Michael LaPaglia.** LaPaglia is an entrepreur who also appears to have no political experience. He sees the need to “reduce unnecessary regulation and ease the regulatory burden on business.”

**NC Superintendent of Public Instruction.** 

This person will be a member of the state Board of Education. The role is currently held by Republican Mark Johnson who is embroiled in all sorts of drama (see his description in the Lieutenant Governor section) but is nonetheless running for Lieutenant Governor. 

**Catharine Truitt.** Truitt is a lifelong educator and was an education advisor to Pat McCrory. She is also now the Chancellor of Western Governors University North Carolina. The issues of importance to her are to have qualified teachers in all classrooms, ensure graduates are college and career-ready, and engage public-private partnerships for schools. She doesn’t say anything about charter schools, vouchers or teacher pay which other candidates discuss. 

**Craig Horn.** On 2/24 when I wrote this summary, Horn’s website appears to have been hijacked by an erectile dysfunction company so it was difficult to learn about his past or current positions. From what I can gather, Horn is currently a Union County State Representative. Although he is running for the superintendent role, he actually thinks the governor should appoint the superintendent role (37 states in fact do that).

**Here is the Democratic ballot**

I won’t go over the presidential candidates but according to the Board of Elections website, most of the candidates who filed will still be on the ballot even though they officially ended their campaigns: Booker, Castro, Gabbard, and so on. And of course, Michael Bloomberg will be on the North Carolina presidential ballot.  

**US Senate Candidates:** 

**Erica Smith.** Smith is a liberal candidate supporting the “Medicare for All,”  the Green New Deal and a $15 minimum wage. Smith continues to be in the midst of controversy (though no fault of her own) as she was supposedly receiving fundraising support from Republicans who view her to be a more “beatable” candidate in the general election against Thom Tillis (who conservatives presume to be the frontrunner). 

**Steve Swenson.** Swenson is a far-left candidate. His agenda items are to codify Roe v. Wade and to provide $2 trillion in reparations to African-Americans. Swenson’s website has minimal information and he is not seen as a viable candidate. 

**Cal Cunningham.** Cunningham is an Army veteran and a former State Senator. He now owns a waste reduction company in Raleigh. He is the favorite in this primary race and has raised the most funds. His positions are to expand the Affordable Care Act, expand Medicaid and create a public health insurance option.  On the environment, he would like NC to be carbon neutral by 2050 and to cut carbon and public pollution in half by 2030. He believes investing in wind and solar is the path to best transition the economy. Cunningham also supports a $15 minimum wage.

**Trevor Fuller**. Fuller, like Smith, also supports “Medicare for All,” the Green New Deal and a $15 minimum wage. Fuller is a lawyer at his own law firm and has been involved in local Charlotte politics for several years having served for 3 terms as a Charlotte City Commissioner. 

**Atul Goel.** Goel believes that he can solve the health care crisis but hasn’t outline any specifics on how. He is an immigrant and a pro-gun Democrat. He is a physician, a pilot and an active duty flight surgeon in the US Air Force. He says little on his website about education, income inequality or the environment. 

**US House or Representatives:**

Remember, that this was the role that Dan McCready lost to Dan Bishop in 2017. The winner of this race will contest Bishop in November (Bishop is uncontested in the Republican primary). The lone female candidate is from Mecklenburg County versus the others candidates who are from lesser known parts of the district. That fact should help her.  

**Harry Southerland.** This candidate is from Hoke County (pop 54k) east of Charlotte. He is a lawyer who then started a “sports and entertainment management and consulting agency.”  He supports the $15 minimum wage, homeless shelters, aid to “historically black colleges and universities” (Harry is African-American), expanded meals and home repair for seniors, affordable healthcare and aid to veterans/military. 

**Cynthia Wallace**. Wallace was the chair of NC Democratic party District 9. She was an advocate of Dan McCready in the last election and has a platform similar to his: good jobs, affordable healthcare and lower prescription drug costs, high quality public education, improved infrastructure.  She is likely to be the front-runner because the other candidates are from rural regions outside of Mecklenburg County and therefore have a smaller base, and are unlikely to attract Charlotte and Union County voters who are essential to winning the election.  She also has received the endorsement of groups like Indivisible which played a large role in Dan McCready’s campaign over the last few years. 

**Marcus Williams.** Williams is a lawyer from Lumberton. His issues include job production, environmental protections, educational excellence, universal access to medical insurance. He ran unsuccessfully for Attorney General in 2016. 

**Clayton Brooks.** Brooks, in his early 30s, is a Harvard-educated Baptist minister who believes the “country’s social safety net too often fails the most vulnerable.”  He supports lower healthcare costs, job development, and the restoration of educational funding. He is an advocate of veterans and would like to address the over-incarceration of AfricanAmericans. 

**NC Governor**

**Ernest Reeves.** Reeves appears to have a strong military background (former enlisted soldier, former Escort Officer for the Administrator of Iraq, former military assistant to the staff of an ambassador. His key issues are “strong (safe) schools, communities, good paying jobs, tax breaks for small businesses, lower tuition costs for students, safe zones for our kids, apprenticeship programs for unemployed individuals, and a robust transportation system.” He also wants to expand Medicare and Medicaid. He has run for office nine times since 2014 and has not yet been elected to a role. 

**Roy Cooper.** Cooper is the incumbent Governor who has served since 2017. Pay increases for teachers, which stagnated under Republican governors, is a major milestone under Cooper’s leadership. He has been in NC politics for years having served 4 terms as Attorney General. He lists a number of issues on his website ranging from education and the environment to jobs, infrastructure and disaster recovery. 

**NC Lieutenant Governor:**

This race is 2nd in line to the governor and presides over the NC Senate.  Even though it has little power, [this article does a good job explaining why anyone would want it](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article238269133.html). All the Democratic candidates have experience in local or state politics and seem versed in NC issues. None appear to have any serious scandals, arrests or other dubious incidents in their past. The slate also offers some diversity: two candidates are women (Van Duyn and Holley) and three are African-American (Beasley, Newton and Holley). 

**Allen Thomas.** Thomas is the fomer mayor of Greenville NC which is in the eastern part of the state close to the coast. His platform is that he wants to “ensure rural and coastal communities have the resources to rebuild, support economic and infrastructure development and expand access to quality education.” 

**Bill Toole.** Toole is a pro-cannibis candidate and estimates that legalizing it in NC would generate $450MM for the state which he’d like to use to hire a nurse and counselor at every school. “Healthcare and aging” are also important elements to his platform.  While Toole sounds like a New Yorker in his ads, he is a native North Carolinean. He’s been an environmental lawyer for 27 years and has worked on “wetland protection, land clean up, and environmental compliance.”  He has been a Belmont city councilman and was chair of the Democratic party of Gaston County. Toole has been endorsed by The Charlotte Post. 

**Terry Van Duyn.** Van Duyn comes from a “systems analyst” background. While she has lived in NC for many years, she went to college in Illinois. She is currently a state senator from the Asheville area and has served since 2014. Van Duyn’s website says that she has worked hard to improve public schools, protect the environment, and advocate for a more transparent and effective government. She is considered to be “the favorite and leading fundraiser.” 

**Chaz Beasley.** Beasley is an attorney at Alston & Bird, and is also now an NC House of Representatives member and lives in Steele Creek. He is young and well-educated (he graduated from Harvard in 2008, which would put him in his early 30s, and later from Georgetown Law School) and counts his top issues as education, health care and transportation. He supports higher pay for teachers, broader Medicaid coverage, and more mass transit. He is against privatization efforts like the I-77 initiative. He also pushed for the NC law that teaches financial literacy in schools (at the expense of history classes).  Beasley was endorsed by The IndyWeek. 

**Yvonne Lewis Holley.** Holley is from Wake County and has worked hard during her house tenure (which is now over 7 years) to relieve food deserts. Her key initiative includes the “affordable living initiative” which focuses on affordable and attainable housing, affordable and healthy food, economic and workforce development, transportation, and public education. Many of these sound like issues that city councils may be better equipped to handle than the Lieutenant Governor but the issues are critical ones. 

**Ron Newton.** Newton is a former police officer and currently a businessman and lawyer. He has served in various political roles in the past including on a Board of Education and supported Hillary Clinton for president. He ran for the Lieutenant Governor role in 2016 as well. He believes that NC needs a New Direction that can be achieved by a politician (such as himself) who can  “ensure health care for everyone, reduce poverty, fund public education, bring about criminal justice reform, attack wealth inequality, protect our environment, and make our government something that all residents can be proud of.”

**NC Auditor:** 

This role has oversight for the accounting and financial functions of the state. It also acts as a watchdog over state agencies so it requires candidates with strong accounting skills. Both candidates running appear to be strong.  

**Luis Toledo**. Toledo is an audit manager for E&Y and adjunct public policy professor at Elon. He seems competent but the key reason to vote for him is that you believe that we shouldn’t have the same elected officials in the same roles election after election (the current incumbent won 3 previous elections). 

**Beth A Wood.** Wood is the incumbent and she is running for her 4th term as the state auditor. On her website, she says she’s saved the NC millions of dollars by auditing things like prison medical billing and employee reviews. She seems competent and I wasn’t able to find anything scandalous about her tenure. 

**NC Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services**

This role exists to find “new markets” for NC farm products, preserve working farms and protect the state’s food supply. The role is currently held by a Republican and is elected every 4 years. This role also manages weights and measures, gas and oil inspection and operates the NC State Fair and state farmers markets. The salary is $125k. 

**Walter Smith.** Smith is a current farmer and the top issue listed on his site is “food insecurity.” He is involved in some local government as well. 

**Jenna Wadsworth.** Wadsworth appears to be an interesting candidate. She was elected to be the Wake County Soil and Water Conservation District Board of Supervisors while she was still in college. She is in her early 30s now. She is from the Triangle area, having attended North Carolina School of Science and Math for high school and NC State for college. She grew up on a farm and her key issues are farmland preservation, not just “writing relief checks.” She supports hemp and cannabis as new crops and has been endorsed by AFL-CIO, NC Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood Votes South Atlantic

**Donovan Alexander Watson.**  Watson says he wants to “maintain and increase number of NC farms”, collaborate with great research institutions, and expand agricultural opportunity.  From his website, it is unclear if he has any public service experience. 

**NC Superintendent of Public Instruction:**

This person will be a member of the state Board of Education. The role is currently held by Republican Mark Johnson who appears to now be running for Lieutenant Governor. 

**Keith Sutton.** Sutton is currently is an education innovation consultant. He has a number of points in his platform including more targeted support to underperforming schools, including affected by race and poverty, improvement of teacher and principal compensation and enhancement of wages for support personnel to $15, and support for rural schools. 

**James Barrett.** He has spent his entire career in IT leadership and for 8 years served on the Board of Education of Chapel Hill-Carrboro Schools. The first issue in his platform is to reduce testing for students and “overhaul how we test and why.” His LinkedIn profile describes him as a “public schools advocate and policy nerd.” He was involved in a local controversy in 2018 when he advocated creating a Mandarin magnet school in his school district which was seen as helping affluent white and Asian students at the expense of other minorities. 

**Constance (Lav) Johnson.** Johnson’s key platform issues include teacher pay, recycling, parent classes and free lunch for all students. She comes from a family of four generations of teachers

**Michael Maher.** Maher’s key issues include transparency and accessibility, charter school, testing and literacy. He has been a faculty member in the education department at NC State, he’s been a public school teacher in Winston-Salem and Wake County, and his website says he’s been a policy leader and state and national education advocate. 

**Jen Mangrum.** Mangrum is also a longtime educator, working on the education faculty at NC State and having been a public school teacher for 14 years. Her key platform elements include expanding funding for classrooms, securing a living wage for personnel and getting spend for digital resources. She is endorsed by NC Teachers United and NC Association of Educators. 

**NC District Court Judge:**

This is a NC court that tries civil, criminal, juvenile and magistrate matters. 

**Aretha Blake.** Blake is currently a district court judge for Mecklenburg County. Blake has been accused of not ruling on cases regarding family law for several years, leaving families in limbo. 

**Lynna Moen.** Moen is a family law attorney in Charlotte for over 7 years. Because of Blake’s poor track record with adjudication, it appears to be worthwhile to consider an alternative. 

**NC Treasurer:**

The treasurer’s office “manages the state’s retirement system, investments, and unclaimed property and provides financial support to local governments.” This includes pension plans, debt issuance, 401k plans and the state’s disability program.  The position is currently held by a Republican and elected every four years. That person, Dale Folwell, is a private investor and financial advisor who has served in the NC House.  One of the candidates running calls it “the most important position that no one’s ever heard of” because it manages the $95B pension for state employees. From what I could dig up, many state employees’ retiree account [values have decreased nearly 20%](https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article230839994.html) since the recession which doesn’t match the stock market which has nearly quadrupled since the recession, though the state’s pension obligations have been problematic. 

**Dimple Ajmera.** Ajmera is currently a member of Charlotte’s City Council. She is one of the younger council members (in her early 30s) and is a CPA. She says on her website that she “will work tirelessly for access to healthcare for all, protect taxpayers, and invest in a sustainable infrastructure and resilient future.” Whether she has the chops to manager the $95B pension fund when the largest budget she has managed is the $2B Charlotte city budget seems to be a disconnect. 

**Ronnie Chatterji.** Chatterji is an associate professor at Duke’s Business School and previously served as a Senior Economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisors where he was involved with policies related to “innovation, entrepreurship, infrastructure and economic growth.” He says that climate change is important but it’s unclear how he would change the current investment approach to address that.  Many of his tweets include #TheNerdWeNeed.  He is endorsed by the AFL-CIO and the NC Association of Educators.

**Matt Leatherman.** Leatherman was the policy director and staff director, corporate governance committee for the NC Department of State Treasurer and then a research director at FCLT Global. Leatherman’s father was actually the chairman of the Rowan County Republican Party though he is a Democrat. [His primary driver of running](https://www.salisburypost.com/2019/07/26/rowan-native-matt-leatherman-announces-bid-for-nc-treasurer/) for office is that his young daughter was born several months premature and spent nearly 6 months in the NICU which led to thousands of dollars in medical bills which he is afraid will be cut for other state employees. Leatherman believes that the incumbent Republican “has been cutting back preventative care programs and also threatening to reduce reimbursements to doctors and hospitals to such levels that a lot of medical offices are worried that they might not be able to stay open, particularly in more rural areas.” I’m a bit concerned about Leatherman because he seems to be running to help select a different healthcare plan for state employees versus managing the multi-billion dollar state pension fund which is the main goal of the state treasury. Personally, it seems like this isn’t the best forum to fix health care which should be a much bigger initiative than the plan that state employees get.  

**Board of Commissioners at Large (vote for 3):**

The Board of Commissioners enacts local ordinances, approves the city budget and oversees spending. 

**Ella Scarborough.** Scarborough is an incumbent. She has left little to no digital footprint of her positions yet she has served in local politics in some role (first as a city councilwoman in 1987) for many years. 

**Lloyd Scher.** Former member of the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners. 

**Brenda Stevenson.** Stevenson has been involved at a hyper-local level for the Democratic party. She served as the chair of Precinct 41 and was a delegate at the DNC in Charlotte years ago. She supports affordable housing, food pantries for those in need, and resources for mental health issues. 

**Leigh Altman.** Altman is a public interest attorney and has raised a significant amount of money for her campaign and has received a fair amount of attention. Altman’s key issues include economic empowerment, mental health in schools and communities, reproductive rights and reduction in gun violence. 

**Pat Cotham.** Cotham is also an incumbent on the board. She opposed the proposed county sales tax that failed in November which was supposed to help the fine arts community and schools. 

**Terra Lee Long.** Long hopes to prioritize healthcare and currently serves as chair of the Health Care Justice North Carolina legislative committee as well as a member of the Charlotte Area Fund Board. She is a graduate of UNCC. 

**Tigress McDaniel.** McDaniel is a perpetual candidate on virtually every election ballot. She has run for Charlotte Mayor and for the Soil and Water Conservation Board in the last 2 elections. She generally fares poorly in these elections because it is now known to many voters that has a long list of lawsuits she has filed even though she isn’t a lawyer. She also has a felony arrest for identity theft

**Ray McKinnon.** McKinnon is a pastor at South Tryon Community United Methodist Church.",1582690775.0,CitizenProfane,"Election Summary Sheet: Here are all the candidates on the Republican and Democratic Ballots for Charlotte Voters I've been doing this for the last 3 elections and people tell me it's useful so here it goes again. There are a LOT of candidates in this upcoming primary. I did my best to provide a summary of most of them (I omitted the presidential candidates, and the board members representing specific districts). I start with the Republican ballot. You must scroll way down for for the Democratic ballot. Independents can choose which primary they want to vote in.  If you have comments or additional information to inform voters, please add them at the bottom.  Be informed and vote!  

**Here’s what is on the Republican ballot.**

I won’t go into detail on the presidential candidates though it is important to note that there are two serious candidates against Trump. **Bill Weld** was the former governor of Massachusetts and **Joe Walsh** is a vocal former congressman who feels that Republicans should get another choice. 

**US Senate candidates:** 

**Thom Tillis.** Tillis is the incumbent first elected in 2014 (who will likely have a tough race in November but should sail through the primary). He stayed within party lines and has supported Trump and has advocated anti-abortion issues and some anti-Internet marketplace actions (e.g. anti-counterfeit measures, the SANTA Act which forces more accountability on the part of marketplace sellers). He calls himself a “common sense fiscal conservative.” He is a critic of tax increases and “passionate about serving active military members, veterans and their families.” He supported Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and “the President’s stance on border security.” Tillis was previously speaker of the NC House. In the House, he supported the 2nd Amendment, anti-abortion initiatives and voter ID efforts. He lives in Huntersville.

**Paul Wright**. Wright was a former judge (District Court judge, Superior Court Judge). Wright, like his name, leans right. He has a “lifelong interest in conservative politics.” He believes “Christianity should be rightfully restored to its proper place to protect the rights of the people.” He is worried about dechristianization (“America losing its soul”), supports the 2nd Amendment and the right to bear arms, supports building a border wall and ending sanctuary cities, and wants to reverse same-sex marriage. 

**Larry Holmquist.** Holmquist claims to be a “consistent conservative” and is a far-right candidate. He is pro-wall and 2nd amendment, anti-abortion (he thinks Planned Parenthood is “despicable”), pro term limits (thinks both Senators and House reps should have 12 years only), anti-Obamacare and pro strong national defense. He is “disgusted by Thom Tillis’ ‘flip-flopping’” and asserts that Thom Tillis is opposed to Trump’s border wall.  He is a supporter of energy companies (“over-zealous environmentalists” should not be allowed to “shackle the country’s energy output.”) He also wants to abolish federal education standards and let cities and counties determine education. He is from the Midwest (Illinios and Iowa), lives in Greensboro, and is a former salesman and businessman. 

**Sharon Hudson.** Hudson is a graduate of UNCC, lives in the Charlotte area and appears to be a moderate candidate. She is anti-Thom Tillis because she didn’t like the I-77 toll road expansion which she thinks he pushed. She believes these “failing financial models shouldn’t be forced on the American people.” She is pro-environment (though doesn’t mention anything specific to save it). She believes illegal immigrants should have “a strong guest worker program.” She is pro-life and supports “charter schools, private schools and homeschooling.” Her father was a cousin of Chuck Yeager (she’s from West Virginia where Yeager is from; Yeager was the first pilot to break the sound barrier). 

**NC Governor:**

**Dan Forest.** Forest is an architect by training. He served for two terms as the Lieutenant Governor (2 terms max is what the NC Constitution allows). He is also a very conservative candidate: he supports school choice, was pro HB2, has voted against climate change legislation and is anti-gun control.  He is as close to political royalty in Charlotte as one gets: he is the son of Sue Myrick, the Congresswoman from District 9 from 1995-2013 and former Charlotte mayor.  Forest is in the midst of a money scandal because he recently received an in-kind donation from a donor who was indicted for financial crimes. 

**Holly Grange.**  Grange has a sparse website but decent experience; “Trump supporter” is one of the few words on her homepage. She is a “wife, mother, military veteran and member of NC House or Representatives.” She went to West Point. Her plan under “jobs & economy” on her website says that she supports tort reform to crackdown on trial lawyers and “jackpot justice.” She wants sheriffs to cooperate with ICE (unlike Mecklenburg Country’s sheriff). She is pro-life, pro-veteran and pro first responders (police and firefighters). She lives in Wilmington. 

**NC Lieutenant Governor:** 

This is an understandably less scrutinized race than governor as the role has less responsibility (even though the salary, $125k, is almost as much as the Governor’s). This role is like the Vice President: it is 2nd in line to the governorship, and it presides over the NC Senate. The role also serves on the NC Board of Education, the NC Capital Planning Commission, the NC Board of Community Colleges and is Chairman of eLearning Commission.  I’m not sure why there are as many candidates as there are though [this article explains it](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article238269133.html): many believe it is a stepping stone, a “cushy” job with a good title and relatively little attention.  

**John Ritter.** Ritter is a lawyer in Moore County and a new father. It does not appear that he has any political experience. He is an advocate of vocational education, strong infrastructure, and fiscal responsibility. 

**Mark Robinson.** Robinson has little political experience. He served in the Army reserves and held a number of different jobs as a factory and restaurant shift worker. He gave an impassioned speech about the right for citizens to own guns to the Greensboro City Council in April 2018 which made its way to YouTube and was well-received by conservatives as he critiqued the “loonies on the left.” He is also African American, which makes him a unique and appealing spokesperson for conservatives. 

**Scott Stone.** Stone is a businessman and civil engineer from South Charlotte. He was an NC House member from Mecklenburg County until he lost in 2018 when there was a “blue wave” in the county. He’s ambitious--he tried to run for mayor of Charlotte twice. His platform in this election is about reduced regulation and taxes, standing up to sanctuary sheriffs, protecting the 2nd Amendment and enforcing voter ID laws and advocating against abortion.

**Andy Wells.** Wells is currently an NC State Senator for a rural area near Winston-Salem. He was an NC House member before that. He is a business owner of a real estate development company and his website indicates he is supportive of voter ID laws and not supportive of sanctuary sheriffs. 

**Buddy Bengal.** Bengal is a young entrepreneur in New Bern with restaurants, a small baseball team and a syrup company to his name. He is an advocate of job creation and economic development and believes he can be a “salesman for the state.” He also mentions accountability for public employees but it’s unclear what that means other than to “reorganize inefficient or bloated departments.” 

**Deborah Cochran.** Cochran is a former mayor of Mt Airy and teacher at a local high school. She says that she is an advocate of teachers. Her website states nothing specific about her issues other than esoteric statements like “I want to be the voice for all of NC.” While mayor, she says she led on the following issues: “responsible governance, lowering property tax rates, and public safety as necessities for citizens.”

**Renee Ellmers.** Ellmers was a US House Representative for the 2nd District of NC (which include Raleigh) from 2011 to 2017. Ellmers was a nurse elected to office in the Tea Party wave of 2010.  She lost the GOP primary in 2016 amid allegations that she had an affair with Kevin McCarthy, the US House Minority Leader. She has been accused of being not conservative enough (she, with other Republican women, tried to stop a vote on banning abortions after 20 weeks—she disagreed with some of the rape provisions). In fact, others in the Republican party have accused her of being a RINO (Republican In Name Only). 

**Greg Gebhardt.** Gebhardt is a military veteran and was an author of the NC voter ID law. His platform includes enforcing “common-sense legislation that enforces immigration laws,” advocating against abortion, defending the 2nd Amendment and “fighting socialism.” Healthcare and education are listed last on his platform page. 

**Mark Johnson.** Johnson is currently the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He says he is running to “fight complacency in state government.” As superintendent, he was against the Common Core and that got him into many fights with what he called “bureaucratic fiefdoms” and the “deep state.” He was caught in controversy for awarding an $8MM computer-based testing solution when an advisory committee said otherwise, and for monitoring an employee’s text messages illegally. He was also accused of purchasing $6MM in iPads that didn’t follow protocol and happened after a trip to Apple’s headquarters in Silicon Valley. 

**NC Attorney General:**

The NC Attorney General is the top law enforcement officer and top lawyer of the state. According to the NC Department of Justice website, “the Attorney General oversees criminal appeals from state courts to ensure that criminals are kept behind bars and innocent people are not. \[The role\] also ensures that consumers are protected by going after scam artists and corporate bad actors. The Attorney General protects the taxpayers as well, by providing legal representation to state government agencies, departments and commissions, and by investigating and cracking down on Medicaid fraud.”

**Jim O’Neill.** O’Neill served as Forsyth County District Attorney since 2009. He ran for NC District Attorney in 2016 and lost the primary (the role is currently held by a Democrat). He says he will address the backlog of sexual assault kits that are with the state, support federal immigration policy (he supports ICE) and not support sanctuary cities, and will fight the opioid crisis. He is also an advocate of the death penalty. 

**Sam Hayes.** Hayes is a conservative candidate who has served as the general counsel for a number of state level positions. His website mentions the importance of enforcing voter ID laws, the 2nd amendment and a number of other conservative issues. 

**Christine Mumma.** Mumma is a career lawyer and says she is conservative. She says she believes in “the sanctity of life” and is the Executive Director of the NC Center on Actual Innocence where she represented and exonerated 9 men who were wrongfully convicted. O’Neill has aired some attack ads claiming that some of Mumma’s clients were in fact guilty. 

**NC Auditor:**

This position performs audits for state governments. Some of the CPAs applying for Treasurer would probably be better suited for this role. 

**Anthony (Tony) Street**. Street is from Brunswick County and has worked in nuclear security and commercial fishing and has operated a small business. He has a master’s in public administration from UNC Pembroke. He says he wants ensure voters know how their money is spent but I’m not sure he has the accounting qualifications to execute this role. 

**Tim Hoegemeyer.** This candidate served in the military and also has an MPA (from NC State). He has been the general counsel to the Office of the State Auditor (though he’s not listed in the NC Auditor’s website as a staff member, presumably because he recently gave notice to run for this role). He has said that he wants to proactively seek out fraud and waste versus just responding to hotline tips.  

**NC Commissioner of Insurance:**

This role regulates the insurance industry in North Carolina, licenses insurance professionals, educations customers about insurance and handles customer complaints about insurance.  The salary is $125k

**Ronald Pierce.** Pierce ran in the last primary for this role in 2016 and appears to have an ax to grind because he believes that Wayne Goodwin (former Insurance Commissioner wrongfully accused him of crimes). On the homepage of his website, he says he believes that the current incumbent (Mike Causey) has “done nothing substantial to correct the situation.” The situation in question is that Goodwin (now the current Chair of the NC Democratic Party) had Pierce arrested on 108 fraud charges in 2014 though Pierce insists they are “false charges.” The charges were ultimately dismissed. Pierce believes that this division of government should support consumers not insurance companies. He also wants to reduce conflicts of interest (eg any employee must wait 3 years before being employed by, say, an insurance company). 

**Mike Causey.** Causey is the incumbent and the State Fire Marshal. He’s an Army veteran and worked in the insurance industry for 25 years. His website says his “goal as commissioner is to fight for more competition in the industry and to combat insurance fraud to drive rates lower for the North Carolina consumer.  He is also passionate about making the office more consumer-friendly to help residents attain their insurance needs.” Causey is currently embroiled in the same scandal as Dan Forest who is accused of accepting funds from a wealthy donor who is now accused of bribery. Causey was evidently an FBI informant in that case. (Hat’s off to the Charlotte Observer for great reporting on this issue—long live local journalism.) 

**NC Commissioner of Labor.** 

I’m fascinated by this position because it replaces Cherie Berry! You know, the woman whose photo is on every elevator in NC (she’s evidently been in that role for two decades). Berry has had a reputation of being soft on employers who violate labor laws. This position also does a number of other important as well things like inspect amusement park rides and investigate employment discrimination. 

**Chuck Stanley.** There is little information online about Stanley. He doesn’t appear to have a website, nor are there photos that appear on any election related sites. 

**Josh Dobson.** Dobson is currently a state representative and also a former county commissioner.  He appears to have raised more money in this race than his opponents. He also doesn’t think this role should be “on a crusade” to prosecute businesses. He has the endorsement of NC Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler and NC Congressman Mark Meadows.  

**Pearl Burris Floyd.** Floyd has served in a number of government roles (State Representative, Gaston County Commissioner). Floyd has Berry’s endorsement and says has firsthand experience with workplace safety issues working as a lab safety officer. She is also on the UNC Board of Governors and an African-American woman in the Republican party.

**NC Secretary of State:**

This role is the head the economic and business-related operations of the state. 

**EC Sykes.** Sykes says he wants to help NC by “bringing transparency and efficiency to our state government with commonsense policies like honoring the rule of law, cutting waste, limiting the size of government, and restoring citizens’ confidence in our government.” His homepage announces that he is “a man of strong faith.” He was a former Ted Cruz campaign volunteer. He does not appear to have any political background but does have a business background. 

**Chad Brown.** Brown is the current Gaston County Commissioner. His website says he is pro 2nd Amendment, pro-life and that he promotes transparency. Below those values, he outlines his positions and accomplishments as county commissioner: in particular, he introduced a small business tax credit. He wants people to know that NC is “open for business.”

**Michael LaPaglia.** LaPaglia is an entrepreur who also appears to have no political experience. He sees the need to “reduce unnecessary regulation and ease the regulatory burden on business.”

**NC Superintendent of Public Instruction.** 

This person will be a member of the state Board of Education. The role is currently held by Republican Mark Johnson who is embroiled in all sorts of drama (see his description in the Lieutenant Governor section) but is nonetheless running for Lieutenant Governor. 

**Catharine Truitt.** Truitt is a lifelong educator and was an education advisor to Pat McCrory. She is also now the Chancellor of Western Governors University North Carolina. The issues of importance to her are to have qualified teachers in all classrooms, ensure graduates are college and career-ready, and engage public-private partnerships for schools. She doesn’t say anything about charter schools, vouchers or teacher pay which other candidates discuss. 

**Craig Horn.** On 2/24 when I wrote this summary, Horn’s website appears to have been hijacked by an erectile dysfunction company so it was difficult to learn about his past or current positions. From what I can gather, Horn is currently a Union County State Representative. Although he is running for the superintendent role, he actually thinks the governor should appoint the superintendent role (37 states in fact do that).

**Here is the Democratic ballot**

I won’t go over the presidential candidates but according to the Board of Elections website, most of the candidates who filed will still be on the ballot even though they officially ended their campaigns: Booker, Castro, Gabbard, and so on. And of course, Michael Bloomberg will be on the North Carolina presidential ballot.  

**US Senate Candidates:** 

**Erica Smith.** Smith is a liberal candidate supporting the “Medicare for All,”  the Green New Deal and a $15 minimum wage. Smith continues to be in the midst of controversy (though no fault of her own) as she was supposedly receiving fundraising support from Republicans who view her to be a more “beatable” candidate in the general election against Thom Tillis (who conservatives presume to be the frontrunner). 

**Steve Swenson.** Swenson is a far-left candidate. His agenda items are to codify Roe v. Wade and to provide $2 trillion in reparations to African-Americans. Swenson’s website has minimal information and he is not seen as a viable candidate. 

**Cal Cunningham.** Cunningham is an Army veteran and a former State Senator. He now owns a waste reduction company in Raleigh. He is the favorite in this primary race and has raised the most funds. His positions are to expand the Affordable Care Act, expand Medicaid and create a public health insurance option.  On the environment, he would like NC to be carbon neutral by 2050 and to cut carbon and public pollution in half by 2030. He believes investing in wind and solar is the path to best transition the economy. Cunningham also supports a $15 minimum wage.

**Trevor Fuller**. Fuller, like Smith, also supports “Medicare for All,” the Green New Deal and a $15 minimum wage. Fuller is a lawyer at his own law firm and has been involved in local Charlotte politics for several years having served for 3 terms as a Charlotte City Commissioner. 

**Atul Goel.** Goel believes that he can solve the health care crisis but hasn’t outline any specifics on how. He is an immigrant and a pro-gun Democrat. He is a physician, a pilot and an active duty flight surgeon in the US Air Force. He says little on his website about education, income inequality or the environment. 

**US House or Representatives:**

Remember, that this was the role that Dan McCready lost to Dan Bishop in 2017. The winner of this race will contest Bishop in November (Bishop is uncontested in the Republican primary). The lone female candidate is from Mecklenburg County versus the others candidates who are from lesser known parts of the district. That fact should help her.  

**Harry Southerland.** This candidate is from Hoke County (pop 54k) east of Charlotte. He is a lawyer who then started a “sports and entertainment management and consulting agency.”  He supports the $15 minimum wage, homeless shelters, aid to “historically black colleges and universities” (Harry is African-American), expanded meals and home repair for seniors, affordable healthcare and aid to veterans/military. 

**Cynthia Wallace**. Wallace was the chair of NC Democratic party District 9. She was an advocate of Dan McCready in the last election and has a platform similar to his: good jobs, affordable healthcare and lower prescription drug costs, high quality public education, improved infrastructure.  She is likely to be the front-runner because the other candidates are from rural regions outside of Mecklenburg County and therefore have a smaller base, and are unlikely to attract Charlotte and Union County voters who are essential to winning the election.  She also has received the endorsement of groups like Indivisible which played a large role in Dan McCready’s campaign over the last few years. 

**Marcus Williams.** Williams is a lawyer from Lumberton. His issues include job production, environmental protections, educational excellence, universal access to medical insurance. He ran unsuccessfully for Attorney General in 2016. 

**Clayton Brooks.** Brooks, in his early 30s, is a Harvard-educated Baptist minister who believes the “country’s social safety net too often fails the most vulnerable.”  He supports lower healthcare costs, job development, and the restoration of educational funding. He is an advocate of veterans and would like to address the over-incarceration of AfricanAmericans. 

**NC Governor**

**Ernest Reeves.** Reeves appears to have a strong military background (former enlisted soldier, former Escort Officer for the Administrator of Iraq, former military assistant to the staff of an ambassador. His key issues are “strong (safe) schools, communities, good paying jobs, tax breaks for small businesses, lower tuition costs for students, safe zones for our kids, apprenticeship programs for unemployed individuals, and a robust transportation system.” He also wants to expand Medicare and Medicaid. He has run for office nine times since 2014 and has not yet been elected to a role. 

**Roy Cooper.** Cooper is the incumbent Governor who has served since 2017. Pay increases for teachers, which stagnated under Republican governors, is a major milestone under Cooper’s leadership. He has been in NC politics for years having served 4 terms as Attorney General. He lists a number of issues on his website ranging from education and the environment to jobs, infrastructure and disaster recovery. 

**NC Lieutenant Governor:**

This race is 2nd in line to the governor and presides over the NC Senate.  Even though it has little power, [this article does a good job explaining why anyone would want it](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article238269133.html). All the Democratic candidates have experience in local or state politics and seem versed in NC issues. None appear to have any serious scandals, arrests or other dubious incidents in their past. The slate also offers some diversity: two candidates are women (Van Duyn and Holley) and three are African-American (Beasley, Newton and Holley). 

**Allen Thomas.** Thomas is the fomer mayor of Greenville NC which is in the eastern part of the state close to the coast. His platform is that he wants to “ensure rural and coastal communities have the resources to rebuild, support economic and infrastructure development and expand access to quality education.” 

**Bill Toole.** Toole is a pro-cannibis candidate and estimates that legalizing it in NC would generate $450MM for the state which he’d like to use to hire a nurse and counselor at every school. “Healthcare and aging” are also important elements to his platform.  While Toole sounds like a New Yorker in his ads, he is a native North Carolinean. He’s been an environmental lawyer for 27 years and has worked on “wetland protection, land clean up, and environmental compliance.”  He has been a Belmont city councilman and was chair of the Democratic party of Gaston County. Toole has been endorsed by The Charlotte Post. 

**Terry Van Duyn.** Van Duyn comes from a “systems analyst” background. While she has lived in NC for many years, she went to college in Illinois. She is currently a state senator from the Asheville area and has served since 2014. Van Duyn’s website says that she has worked hard to improve public schools, protect the environment, and advocate for a more transparent and effective government. She is considered to be “the favorite and leading fundraiser.” 

**Chaz Beasley.** Beasley is an attorney at Alston & Bird, and is also now an NC House of Representatives member and lives in Steele Creek. He is young and well-educated (he graduated from Harvard in 2008, which would put him in his early 30s, and later from Georgetown Law School) and counts his top issues as education, health care and transportation. He supports higher pay for teachers, broader Medicaid coverage, and more mass transit. He is against privatization efforts like the I-77 initiative. He also pushed for the NC law that teaches financial literacy in schools (at the expense of history classes).  Beasley was endorsed by The IndyWeek. 

**Yvonne Lewis Holley.** Holley is from Wake County and has worked hard during her house tenure (which is now over 7 years) to relieve food deserts. Her key initiative includes the “affordable living initiative” which focuses on affordable and attainable housing, affordable and healthy food, economic and workforce development, transportation, and public education. Many of these sound like issues that city councils may be better equipped to handle than the Lieutenant Governor but the issues are critical ones. 

**Ron Newton.** Newton is a former police officer and currently a businessman and lawyer. He has served in various political roles in the past including on a Board of Education and supported Hillary Clinton for president. He ran for the Lieutenant Governor role in 2016 as well. He believes that NC needs a New Direction that can be achieved by a politician (such as himself) who can  “ensure health care for everyone, reduce poverty, fund public education, bring about criminal justice reform, attack wealth inequality, protect our environment, and make our government something that all residents can be proud of.”

**NC Auditor:** 

This role has oversight for the accounting and financial functions of the state. It also acts as a watchdog over state agencies so it requires candidates with strong accounting skills. Both candidates running appear to be strong.  

**Luis Toledo**. Toledo is an audit manager for E&Y and adjunct public policy professor at Elon. He seems competent but the key reason to vote for him is that you believe that we shouldn’t have the same elected officials in the same roles election after election (the current incumbent won 3 previous elections). 

**Beth A Wood.** Wood is the incumbent and she is running for her 4th term as the state auditor. On her website, she says she’s saved the NC millions of dollars by auditing things like prison medical billing and employee reviews. She seems competent and I wasn’t able to find anything scandalous about her tenure. 

**NC Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services**

This role exists to find “new markets” for NC farm products, preserve working farms and protect the state’s food supply. The role is currently held by a Republican and is elected every 4 years. This role also manages weights and measures, gas and oil inspection and operates the NC State Fair and state farmers markets. The salary is $125k. 

**Walter Smith.** Smith is a current farmer and the top issue listed on his site is “food insecurity.” He is involved in some local government as well. 

**Jenna Wadsworth.** Wadsworth appears to be an interesting candidate. She was elected to be the Wake County Soil and Water Conservation District Board of Supervisors while she was still in college. She is in her early 30s now. She is from the Triangle area, having attended North Carolina School of Science and Math for high school and NC State for college. She grew up on a farm and her key issues are farmland preservation, not just “writing relief checks.” She supports hemp and cannabis as new crops and has been endorsed by AFL-CIO, NC Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood Votes South Atlantic

**Donovan Alexander Watson.**  Watson says he wants to “maintain and increase number of NC farms”, collaborate with great research institutions, and expand agricultural opportunity.  From his website, it is unclear if he has any public service experience. 

**NC Superintendent of Public Instruction:**

This person will be a member of the state Board of Education. The role is currently held by Republican Mark Johnson who appears to now be running for Lieutenant Governor. 

**Keith Sutton.** Sutton is currently is an education innovation consultant. He has a number of points in his platform including more targeted support to underperforming schools, including affected by race and poverty, improvement of teacher and principal compensation and enhancement of wages for support personnel to $15, and support for rural schools. 

**James Barrett.** He has spent his entire career in IT leadership and for 8 years served on the Board of Education of Chapel Hill-Carrboro Schools. The first issue in his platform is to reduce testing for students and “overhaul how we test and why.” His LinkedIn profile describes him as a “public schools advocate and policy nerd.” He was involved in a local controversy in 2018 when he advocated creating a Mandarin magnet school in his school district which was seen as helping affluent white and Asian students at the expense of other minorities. 

**Constance (Lav) Johnson.** Johnson’s key platform issues include teacher pay, recycling, parent classes and free lunch for all students. She comes from a family of four generations of teachers

**Michael Maher.** Maher’s key issues include transparency and accessibility, charter school, testing and literacy. He has been a faculty member in the education department at NC State, he’s been a public school teacher in Winston-Salem and Wake County, and his website says he’s been a policy leader and state and national education advocate. 

**Jen Mangrum.** Mangrum is also a longtime educator, working on the education faculty at NC State and having been a public school teacher for 14 years. Her key platform elements include expanding funding for classrooms, securing a living wage for personnel and getting spend for digital resources. She is endorsed by NC Teachers United and NC Association of Educators. 

**NC District Court Judge:**

This is a NC court that tries civil, criminal, juvenile and magistrate matters. 

**Aretha Blake.** Blake is currently a district court judge for Mecklenburg County. Blake has been accused of not ruling on cases regarding family law for several years, leaving families in limbo. 

**Lynna Moen.** Moen is a family law attorney in Charlotte for over 7 years. Because of Blake’s poor track record with adjudication, it appears to be worthwhile to consider an alternative. 

**NC Treasurer:**

The treasurer’s office “manages the state’s retirement system, investments, and unclaimed property and provides financial support to local governments.” This includes pension plans, debt issuance, 401k plans and the state’s disability program.  The position is currently held by a Republican and elected every four years. That person, Dale Folwell, is a private investor and financial advisor who has served in the NC House.  One of the candidates running calls it “the most important position that no one’s ever heard of” because it manages the $95B pension for state employees. From what I could dig up, many state employees’ retiree account [values have decreased nearly 20%](https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article230839994.html) since the recession which doesn’t match the stock market which has nearly quadrupled since the recession, though the state’s pension obligations have been problematic. 

**Dimple Ajmera.** Ajmera is currently a member of Charlotte’s City Council. She is one of the younger council members (in her early 30s) and is a CPA. She says on her website that she “will work tirelessly for access to healthcare for all, protect taxpayers, and invest in a sustainable infrastructure and resilient future.” Whether she has the chops to manager the $95B pension fund when the largest budget she has managed is the $2B Charlotte city budget seems to be a disconnect. 

**Ronnie Chatterji.** Chatterji is an associate professor at Duke’s Business School and previously served as a Senior Economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisors where he was involved with policies related to “innovation, entrepreurship, infrastructure and economic growth.” He says that climate change is important but it’s unclear how he would change the current investment approach to address that.  Many of his tweets include #TheNerdWeNeed.  He is endorsed by the AFL-CIO and the NC Association of Educators.

**Matt Leatherman.** Leatherman was the policy director and staff director, corporate governance committee for the NC Department of State Treasurer and then a research director at FCLT Global. Leatherman’s father was actually the chairman of the Rowan County Republican Party though he is a Democrat. [His primary driver of running](https://www.salisburypost.com/2019/07/26/rowan-native-matt-leatherman-announces-bid-for-nc-treasurer/) for office is that his young daughter was born several months premature and spent nearly 6 months in the NICU which led to thousands of dollars in medical bills which he is afraid will be cut for other state employees. Leatherman believes that the incumbent Republican “has been cutting back preventative care programs and also threatening to reduce reimbursements to doctors and hospitals to such levels that a lot of medical offices are worried that they might not be able to stay open, particularly in more rural areas.” I’m a bit concerned about Leatherman because he seems to be running to help select a different healthcare plan for state employees versus managing the multi-billion dollar state pension fund which is the main goal of the state treasury. Personally, it seems like this isn’t the best forum to fix health care which should be a much bigger initiative than the plan that state employees get.  

**Board of Commissioners at Large (vote for 3):**

The Board of Commissioners enacts local ordinances, approves the city budget and oversees spending. 

**Ella Scarborough.** Scarborough is an incumbent. She has left little to no digital footprint of her positions yet she has served in local politics in some role (first as a city councilwoman in 1987) for many years. 

**Lloyd Scher.** Former member of the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners. 

**Brenda Stevenson.** Stevenson has been involved at a hyper-local level for the Democratic party. She served as the chair of Precinct 41 and was a delegate at the DNC in Charlotte years ago. She supports affordable housing, food pantries for those in need, and resources for mental health issues. 

**Leigh Altman.** Altman is a public interest attorney and has raised a significant amount of money for her campaign and has received a fair amount of attention. Altman’s key issues include economic empowerment, mental health in schools and communities, reproductive rights and reduction in gun violence. 

**Pat Cotham.** Cotham is also an incumbent on the board. She opposed the proposed county sales tax that failed in November which was supposed to help the fine arts community and schools. 

**Terra Lee Long.** Long hopes to prioritize healthcare and currently serves as chair of the Health Care Justice North Carolina legislative committee as well as a member of the Charlotte Area Fund Board. She is a graduate of UNCC. 

**Tigress McDaniel.** McDaniel is a perpetual candidate on virtually every election ballot. She has run for Charlotte Mayor and for the Soil and Water Conservation Board in the last 2 elections. She generally fares poorly in these elections because it is now known to many voters that has a long list of lawsuits she has filed even though she isn’t a lawyer. She also has a felony arrest for identity theft

Missing the Queen City,"I need to get this out into the universe and maybe it will happen! 

Just touching on 9years ago myself and my now wife moved to Charlotte on a 1year J1 working visa from Ireland. I am sure you already know what bar we worked in as so many Irish have been through there.

I remember it all like it was only yesterday. 1st night there being told by Micheál (who sadly passed since returning home) that there was no bulmers on draft then going to Belfast Mill and thinking that this was the craziest thing I have ever done.

The friends we made along the way who still to this day treat us like a part of their family who have kids of their own who call me uncle and my kids do the same. I miss you all so much. I miss the grilling we did at our place and yours, I miss Wednesday nights with Sk8er Die and singing with them, the bus ride to South Park Mall or the lynx ride to Southend for some shopping.

If I could go back in the morning I would, even if it were to just show our family that part of our lives and not let it go. I know I should move on but Charlotte has a piece of me and always will. 

Anyway I hope you have a great day ahead! 💙🖤",1631002644.0,OtherwiseWalrus,"Missing the Queen City I need to get this out into the universe and maybe it will happen!

Comment below to add your thoughts, or if you see any errors.

# US Senate

This race is one of the pivotal US Senate races because it could determine which party gets control in 2023. The last two US Senate elections in North Carolina had very narrow margins (e.g. a difference of 96k votes in 2020). As this is a high information race for the leading 2 candidates, **Cheri Beasley** and **Ted Budd,** I did not create a writeup for them. You have likely heard far less about the 2 other candidates in this race who represent the Green and Libertarian Parties: **Matthew Hoh** and **Shannon Bray,** respectively. See [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3qG8eXh8wVElokbfKIjkG9Gj_xvybppsl5Q_Ruxoas/edit?usp=sharing) for more on them.

# US House of Representatives District 14

If you are a Charlotte resident, you are either in District 14 or District 12. District 12 voters will choose between Alma Adams or Tyler Lee (I didn’t include them in this writeup as this is for South Charlotte).  District 14 is a newly formed district after North Carolina gained a congressional seat following the last US census. This district covers much of Mecklenburg and Gaston counties. According to the Cook Political Report, it leans Democrat. District 14 voters will choose between **Pat Harrigan** or **Jeff Jackson.**  Harrigan is a former Green Beret and graduate of West Point but does not appear to be a resident of the district.  Jackson is a former assistant DA for Mecklenburg County and has been a state senator since 2014.  He is “one of the most recognizable politicians in the county.”  For a longer writeup, see [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3qG8eXh8wVElokbfKIjkG9Gj_xvybppsl5Q_Ruxoas/edit?usp=sharing).

## NC State Judges: Supreme Court and Court of Appeals

There are a number of judges on this list who are running for reelection. For more information, see the links[ at the bottom of this WRAL page.](https://www.wral.com/how-to-judge-a-judge-a-guide-for-north-carolina-voters/20498257/)

# NC Supreme Court Associate Justice Seat 3

This is the seat left open by Judge Robin Hudson’s retirement. Hudson actually wrote the opinion in the landmark gerrymandering case a few months ago which overturned the districts that the state legislature drew. There are currently 4 Democrats on the Supreme Court and 3 Republicans so these two open seats are extremely important for both parties.

**Richard Dietz.** Dietz been on the Court of Appeals since 2014 and is now running for a “promotion” to the NC Supreme Court. He was the first in his family to go to college, his mother died when he was younger and he graduated first in his law school class at Wake Forest. He has a passion for civic education—there are animated, explainer videos about the law on his website and he has a web class for AP Government students online as well which he says are to educate “the next generation of lawyers.” Dietz incidentally created some of those videos with conservative NC Supreme Court justice Phil Berger Jr. (also the son of the Republican legislator Phil Berger.).Dietz believes his role as a state judge is to create a body of case law that can help others understand and interpret laws. .He mentions in virtually every interview he’s given that he’s never written a dissent on the Court of Appeals, which he said was a sign of his consensus building. He said his motto is “leadership for our courts.” Dietz is listed as a contributor to the Federalist Society website.

Dietz responded to me quickly and shared additional details beyond what was available on his website including his reflections on leadership which he described as “being able to work with others on a team.” He says that he will bring that collegial attitude toward the Supreme Court. I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 45, White, Republican)

**Lucy Inman.** Inman has also been on the NC Court of Appeals since 2014. She has been a lawyer and judge for 30 years and has “served people in communities large and small.” She says she wants to keep the system “free from partisan politics.” She started her career as a journalist. Local lawyers I know in Charlotte have described her as “excellent” for what that’s worth. In[ this video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H0aFFvYTLE&t=493s) she actually seemed to have a good rapport with her opponent and said that both served on the Court of Appeals together and agreed on 100% of the cases where they both ruled together. Unlike Dietz, she said she has authored dissents, which she believes are important when cases get escalated to the state Supreme Court. She believes that dissents are crucial to standing up for what is right. She lost the election to be an NC Supreme Court Associate Justice in 2020; she received 49.3% of the vote while her opponent received 50.7% (incidentally her opponent was Phil Berger, Jr., a friend of Dietz)

A staffer from Inman’s office responded to me shortly after I had reached out. She gave me, as an example of her impartiality and several examples of “decisions that do not fit the stereotype of my political affiliation as a Democrat.” I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 61, White, Democrat)

# NC Supreme Court Associate Justice Seat 5

**Sam J Ervin IV.** Ervin is the only incumbent on the Supreme Court who is running for a position this year. He was previously on the Court of Appeals from 2009 until he joined the NC Supreme Court. He has been a lawyer for 4 decades. He comes from a family of lawyers and believes “everyone deserves the same chances in life.” He says that every case should start with a blank sheet of paper. He is a graduate of Davidson College and Harvard Law School. He is from Morganton, NC. He cites his mother, who was on the Morganton School Board and led efforts to desegregate schools decades ago, as a big influence on his judicial philosophy.

One of Ervin’s team members responded to me with attachments that he had responded to in other interviews. I gave him an A- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 66, White, Democrat)

**Trey Allen.** Allen has been a lawyer for 22 years and is currently the general counsel for NC Administrative Office of the Courts. He is currently the top lawyer for the state court’s system. He says that he doesn’t like “activist judges” and that he will “follow the text and original understanding of the Constitution.” He cited in an interview that the US Supreme Court justice that he identifies with the most are Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. He cites on his website that he and his wife homeschool their five children. His is a protégé of Paul Newby, currently the Chief Justice of the NC Supreme Court (and who beat Cheri Beasley narrowly in 2020).

I did not hear back from Allen in spite of contacting him twice. He also[ did not respond to any of NC Policy Watch either.](https://ncpolicywatch.com/2022/10/13/policy-watch-interviews-nc-supreme-court-candidates-part-one/) He did however respond to an Observer interview in which he said that video conferencing could make it easier for criminal defendants to connect with their attorneys and to make courts cheaper in general. I gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 47, White, Republican)

# NC Court of Appeals Judge Seat 8

**Julee Tate Flood.** Flood is one of the only candidates running for Court of Appeals who is not currently a sitting judge; she does however have a Ph.D. (“law and policy of higher education”) and works for the Court of Appeals. She has taught law classes at law schools and her website cites “upholding our state and federal constitutions,” “following the rule of law,” and “delivering justice for all” as her key principles. She mentions being a grandmother, as does her opponent.

I emailed her twice but didn’t hear back. I gave her an D for accessibility and responsiveness as she did provide multiple ways to contact her on her website. (White, Republican)

**Carolyn Jennings Thompson.** Thompson has 25 years of experience as a District Court and Superior Court judge. Governor Cooper appointed her in 2018 to a Superior Court judgeship; she became the first African American and first woman to serve the 9th Judicial District. She says she brings “thoughtful preparation, respect and knowledge of the law” to all her cases. She has presided “over thousands of cases” in her past as a judge.

I emailed her twice and did not hear back from her. I gave her an F for accessibility and responsiveness. (Black, Democrat)

## NC Court of Appeals Seat 9

**Brad A. Salmon**. Salmon is currently a district court judge. He also started his own law firm before that with his sister-in-law; it appears to be based near Fayetteville. He was a former state legislator (first elected in 2014, representing Lee and Hartnett counties in the 51st house district) and a graduate of Campbell Law School. He was appointed to his current role by Roy Cooper.

He wrote me back after I emailed him for the second time and sent me information that I didn’t see on his website or in any other interviews. I gave him an A- because of his delayed response to me. He said that “If elected to our Court of Appeals, I will bring experience as a practicing attorney, former lawmaker and sitting trial judge.” He also said that “As a legislator, I held the most conservative district that a Democrat represented when I was in the General Assembly.” He considers himself a political moderate. (White, Democrat)

**Donna Stroud.** Stroud was elected to the Court of Appeals in 2006 and is currently the Chief Judge. She did vote to allow the voter ID case that was passed in an election referendum to stand. (The case was brought in 2020 by, among others, the NAACP and the vote was along party lines with the Republican judges voting to uphold the voter ID law, and the Democratic judge dissenting.) She wanted to be a lawyer since she was in 3rd grade and graduated at the top of her law school class. She did say that she would be deferential to the laws made by state legislatures in[ this debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDDtrfV7vkw). Of the Republican judges, she was the only candidate that I have heard (unofficially, according to my personal contacts) get bipartisan support from Charlotte area lawyers.

Stroud wrote me back within 48 hours. Her responses were thoughtful and appreciative of the election process. I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 58, White, Republican)

# NC Court of Appeals Seat 10

**John M Tyson.** Tyson was elected in 2014 and also served on the Court of Appeals from 2001 to 2009. He calls himself an “advocate of life-long learning”—he received two masters degrees in the middle of his career. He spent several decades in private practice. He is a grandfather. Tyson was accused of “assault with a deadly weapon” for allegedly almost hitting protestors back in May 2021. Those charges were dropped. NC judges do appear to have a mandatory retirement age of 72 and Tyson appears to be nearing that age so it is unclear if elected, he would serve a complete term.

Tyson wrote me back quickly with several links and an attachment to a longer interview he gave. He appears to be a “straight shooter” though many of the links showcased a hard-right conservative leaning which could alienate some independents. He seemed responsive however and candid with his opinions so I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 69, White, Republican)

**Gale Murray Adams.** Adams is a former Navy JAG, and then became an Assistant DA and Assistant Federal Public Defender. She was elected to be a Superior Court judge in Cumberland County (Fayetteville) in 2012. She is a native North Carolinian and mother of 4 children.

Adams wrote me back a day after I initially emailed her with thoughtful and polite responses. She said that she’s been an attorney since 1984 and is in her 9th year as a judge. She spent 8 years as a JAG, 4 as an ADA and 20 as a public defender. She said she is running for the Court of Appeals to “safeguard the rights of citizens, promote independence in our courts and to protect the balance of power.” She said that party politics has no place in judicial elections. I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Black, Democrat)

**NC Court of Appeals Seat 11**

**Darren Jackson.** Jackson is an incumbent on the Court of Appeals. He was appointed to the position in 2020 by Governor Cooper. He was in private practice and a state assemblyman prior. Interesting fact: he and Judge Stroud were former law partners. He pointed out that it was uncommon that two attorneys from the same firm would end up on the Court of Appeals, at the same time. He also served 12 years in the general assembly (until he was appointed to the court presumably) and cited that that would be an asset to his understanding what the legislature intended, which is what the Court of Appeals is often entrusted to do. He graduated from Duke’s law school in 1996 and recently became a grandfather.

Jackson wrote me back immediately. He said he is running because he “loves the law” and has enjoyed his time on the Court of Appeals. He pointed out the importance of experienced, knowledgeable judges. He also pointed me to the full body of decisions he wrote on the NC Courts website. I gave him an A for his prompt and direct responses with some instruction on how I may want to navigate the NC Courts website. (Incumbent, Age 52, White, Democrat)

**Michael J Stading.** Stading is from Mint Hill and was an Air Force JAG. More recently, he was a prosecutor and now is a District Court judge. He said he also had his own private practice and all this experience gives him a “panoramic view” of the trial courtroom which would make him a better judge to “understand cases that are appealed from the trial court level.” He is the father of three.

Stading also wrote me back quickly and provided both a thoughtful response and an invitation for citizens to view him in action any time as he is currently a practicing judge in Mecklenburg County. He said “No judge should ever walk in the courthouse thinking they are going to be the best democrat or republican judge.” Rather, judges should always strive to “provide just results to litigants.” I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness.. (Approx age 41, White, Republican)

# NC Superior Court Judge District 26B Seat 1

Superior Court tackles most criminal felonies (which are often jury trials) and civil cases over $25k.

**Matt Osman.** Osman was elected District Judge 3 times since 2010 (twice uncontested) so this would be a “promotion” for him. He was a former US Navy JAG and he has led an effort to reduce the DWI backlog in Mecklenburg County caused by COVID. He is native Charlottean who graduated from Charlotte Christian School and believes in enforcing the law “as it is written.” His website seems to be fairly moderate and he talks about all sides being heard, though I did see an Instagram ad where he said that victims should be heard and criminals should be held accountable. Has received the endorsement of other local Republicans including Tariq Bokhari and Ed Driggs. Has 3 young children.

Osman asked to have a phone call when I reached out and talked to me for about 30 minutes about his judicial philosophy and experience. He said he is running because he always had a desire to be on the Superior Court and was waiting for the right opportunity. He mentioned that he focused on crime as a topic during the election not only because that was what many of his court cases entailed but also because in conversations with local residents, it seemed to be top of their mind. There are people “concerned they can’t run on the greenway in the middle of the day, concerned about carjackings.” I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (White, Republican)

**Kimberly Best.** Best is a former Spanish teacher and court magistrate. She was a District Court judge for 13 years and just recently was appointed to this role by Governor Cooper in late 2021 so she is the incumbent. She attended Indiana University for law school. She is endorsed by Anthony Fox, former mayor of Charlotte and US Secretary of Transportation as well as nearly 4 dozen other prominent individuals in the Charlotte community (including current and former county commissioners and city council members). She mentions being an “advocate for mental illness and intellectual disability awareness and education.” Best has had the misfortune of receiving some negative media attention in recent months (there appeared to be some drama regarding an acrimonious divorce where there were accusations of domestic violence dating back to 2016 and more recently, she was allegedly involved in an altercation with a truck driver who blocked the entrance to the Mecklenburg Court House.)

She wrote me back within hours of my email outreach with grateful, polite and thorough responses to my questions. Regarding her experience she said she “has presided over every courtroom in the courthouse.” She reinforced many of the points she previously mentioned on her website about her judicial philosophy. She said that she “was a victim of crimes and grew up in a city that was once murder capital of the United States. This experience and my resilience have taught me to know when to be tough and when to show grace.” I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Black, Democrat)

# NC District Court Judge 26 Seats 1 and 13-21

District Court involves misdemeanor criminal charges (eg traffic violations, DWIs) and civil cases under $25k. All of these races are uncontested so I did not reach out to candidates. Brief writeups of the candidates are in [this Google Doc. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3qG8eXh8wVElokbfKIjkG9Gj_xvybppsl5Q_Ruxoas/edit?usp=sharing)

# District Attorney, Clerk of Superior Court and County Sheriff

# Board of Commissioners At Large (vote for 3)

Mecklenburg County Commissioners determine the tax rate of county residents and allocate funds for CMS, as well as county-wide services such as courts and parks and recreation.

**Patricia (Pat) Cotham.** Cotham is also an incumbent on the board and has been a fixture in Mecklenburg County politics for years. She has served 5 terms on the board. She seemed to express frustration with CMS in an Observer interview when she said that “CMS has not communicated well and they restrict interaction with us.” She says she has a good relationship with Jeff Jackson and calls herself a “broad-based Democrat” (as opposed to someone focused on a single-issue).

Cotham responded to me soon after I sent her a note through the form field on her website, which was hard to find as her website address is only listed on her Facebook page and leads to a dead link. When I did manage to reach her, her responses were direct. I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness (in spite of a difficult-to-find website) because she responded very quickly. Her responses were terse and direct. (Incumbent, Age 72, White, Democrat)

**Arthur Griffin Jr**. Griffin is a long time civil servant having been previously been the chair of the CMS Board of Education (from 1997 to 2002). He is a retired executive from publishing house McGraw-Hill Education. He believes that absenteeism is a key problem for low-performing CMS schools and proposes quarterly meetings between CMS and other city officials to decrease the achievement gap.

Griffin reached out to me personally responding to my email and in a phone call, he asked that if he did get elected, if I could help address some of the issues I asked about in my outreach to him. I found that to be a rare yet gracious way to engage with his community. He acknowledged that this would be a tough election. He mentioned that his dream for Charlotte would be a “10 minute” neighborhood where all residents had key services available within walking distance. He says he wants to incentivize more construction of vital services like health care near more diverse neighborhoods. He also said that he is not inclined to raise taxes given the increases in property values, but that the county is entrusted with funding many critical services including schools, courts and parks. I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 74, Black, Democrat).

**Tatyana Thulien**. Thulien is a Ukranian immigrant who moved to the US in 1998 and Charlotte in 2011. She has been a singer, journalist and teacher in her time in the US. She says that county residents need to have a “genuine voice for their needs and issues.” She mentioned fair property taxes and public health as two key issues of importance to her. She mentioned being dismayed at the amount of money spent on CMS but without strong results to show for it. She also mentioned that she wants “our faith not to be humiliated and abandoned.” As she grew up in the former Soviet Union, she says that “socialism is not making everyone equal.” She is the mother of two.

I reached out to her a few times and had challenges getting in touch with her. I gave her a C-/D+ for accessibility and responsiveness as a result. (White, Republican)

**Leigh Altman**. Altman is a public interest attorney and an incumbent on the board. She was also an Assistant Attorney General in the state of Georgia many years ago. Altman’s key issues include innovative job initiatives, a strong mental health system, equity in public schools, expanded mass transit options, better funded parks and greenways, LGBTQ rights, a science-based response to the pandemic and transparency in government. She also mentions reducing gun violence. She has talked about women’s reproductive rights issue as well on her website in the past, but that content appears to have been removed.

Altman wrote me back in short but direct sentences soon after I pinged her on her website form field. I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Approx age 50s, White, Democrat)

# Board of Commissioners District 5

**Laura Meier.** Meier is currently serving on the board representing District 5 since 2020. She lists “equitable schools,” “housing” and “parks and recreation” on her website as her areas of advocacy. She also mentions mental health and safe neighborhoods. She is a former teacher of at-risk youths and a graduate of App State University. She was a leader of the Charlotte Women’s March.

She responded to me quickly but seemed skeptical of why I was gathering this information. She responded to me with 3 sentences a few days later. I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness because she provided multiple ways to contact her and she responded quickly but the content of her responses seemed shallow. (Incumbent, Age 53, White, Democrat)

**Matthew Ridenhour.** Ridenhour is a former county commissioner (2012-18) and has run for a number of different public offices since then. He is generally well-regarded as a strong public servant in Mecklenburg County. His website showcases beautiful parks, safe streets and great schools. In an Observer interview, he mentions food deserts and “whether a child has a full stomach” as issues that local government should address. Regarding taxes, he wants a “fair, equitable and transparent revaluation next year.” He also cited defeating the MLS/Memorial Stadium deal which he said would cost taxpayers $100MM. He is the father of two elementary school age children.

Ridenhour wrote me back very quickly and was polite in his tone and responses. I asked him about the single-family zoning changes in Charlotte and he responded that “I lean toward being in favor of removing the single-family zoning, though I would say I only very lightly and cautiously support it.” I also asked him about public charging stations for electric vehicles and he said he wasn’t in favor of using county dollars for it because “those who own electric vehicles—a demographic that tends to be upper middle class or wealthy.” He did however support public electric vehicles for transportation. I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 45, White, Republican)

# Board of Commissioners District 6

Susan Rodriguez-McDowell. She was one of the only commissioners who disagreed with the board about holding back CMS money back in 2021. At the time, that action was viewed as a stunt by many local parents who felt that students would be the biggest losers in that standoff. She did respond to me after a few days but was thoughtful in her response. I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 58, Democrat)

**Jeremy Brasch.** Brasch says he is running to provide choice. He has run twice before for the board of the commission There was very little information about him and I didn’t even see a website. He did however respond immediately to my email and was most vocal when talking about the single family housing zoning changes that were in the news recently (homeowners can now build multifamily units in single family neighborhoods; this is an attempt to relieve housing shortages.) I gave him a B for accessibility and responsiveness, mainly because he appears to have no website. (Age 48, Republican)

**Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education**

This is a non-partisan election though I did cite party affiliation where I found it. CMS has been plagued by a number of issues ranging from low student performance to teacher retention problems to gun incidents and assaults on teachers, as well as missteps in funding allocation, as well as turnover in its superintendent. Nearly everyone who responded to me said that the current Board has failed in its duties.

# CMS Board of Education District 5

This includes Matthews and much of South Charlotte.

**Lisa Cline.** Cline is retired now but was a longtime CMS employees (teacher and assistant principal) who is campaigning on the slogan of “reclaiming education.” Her website has her issues being tackling learning loss, ensuring that graduates are career ready, and creating good communication between parents and schools. While this election is non partisan, Cline is a registered Republican. She said she was involved in the “fight to save Old Providence Park when CMS wanted to build a high school there.”

I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. I wrote her on a Saturday and I received her response back by Monday morning. She offered to also do an in-person meet and greet with me and any other parents I knew if I wanted. She said that her opponent “is supported by a number of public officials, mainly Democrats” and that “I was one of the people who worked long hours with teachers and students to raise the scores” when CMS won the Broad Prize. She says she is the best candidate because she is someone “ who has worked on the East, South, and West sides of Charlotte and was a parent at the same time.” For the full text of her responses, see my spreadsheet and search “Cline.” (Age 62, White, Republican)

**Trent Merchant.** Merchant is a former teacher and theater department director. He is a Charlotte native and his 3 children are or were CMS students. He was a former CMS board member several years ago and says that as “an experienced executive search consultant” he is well-positioned to help the search for the next CMS superintendent. On his website he says that when schools that talk about Jim Crow laws, race-based slavery and secession by the Confederate states, that “is not CRT (critical race theory).” His website had much more comprehensive information that suggested solid insight into current CMS issues. He is currently registered as an unaffiliated voter and is endorsed by a number of current and former city and county elected officials.

I gave Merchant an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. He had multiple ways to contact him on his website and wrote me back without a few hours of my emailing him. He directly answered my questions and had some creative thoughts about the school assignments for the new high school which is in District 5. See the spreadsheet for the full text of his responses. (Age 52, White, Unaffiliated)

# CMS Board of Education District 6

I actually think this was the most competitive district because there is a long-standing incumbent who is broadly respected within the community and his two challenges appear to also be bright, capable, caring individuals. This district includes Ballantyne and Pineville and stretches across the entire southern part of the county.

**Summer Nunn.** Nunn is a mother of 2 CMS children in elementary school and a marketing executive who has worked at a number of regional companies including Red Ventures. She indicates that the board should have parents with children in elementary school which is “45% of our students who are facing very different challenges than they did 5 to 10 years ago.” She serves on her school’s Parent Teacher Leadership team.

When I reached out to her late one evening, she emailed me back the following morning and seemed to be very committed to gathering feedback from the community, particularly on issues like zoning for the new high school in South Charlotte. She said she is “not in favor of censoring materials or teachers' ability to adapt the curriculum to best reach our students just because a parent or a few of them are complaining.” She agrees that CMS has “a leadership problem.” She said that she’s heard from teachers that the leadership changes with the superintendent mean that priorities change which inhibits an idea “to get off the ground or work.” I gave her an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 39, White, Democrat)

**Sean Strain.** Strain is an incumbent on the board and has served since 2017. He lists his priorities as “high expectations and accountability,” “great leaders” and “equity.” He is the father of 4 CMS students. He wants a strong network of neighborhood schools “supplemented by a robust menu of magnet and choice schools.”

Strain was perhaps the most responsive candidate of everyone that I connected with. I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. He is clearly passionate about CMS and has a very strong perspective on where mistakes were made in the past. He believes that he has a reputation as the “voice of reason” and is “not clouded by the various other social issues and agendas that come knocking on a weekly basis.” He said that the Board and the CMS Superintendent need to “stop being politicians” and making political decisions “popular with some of their constituents (e.g., the radical use of age-inappropriate materials in the classroom, lowering standards and expectations for teachers and students)” which was causing the noise. (Incumbent, Age 50, White, Republican)

**Michael Watson.** Watson is the father of 2 CMS high school students. He is an IT professional and a small business owner. The key issues listed on his website are “school safety,” “administrator and teacher retention and recruitment,” “collaboration” and “transparency and communication.” He said that he was originally part of the community discussion around the Rea Farms STEAM program which had concerns from Polo Ridge parents, but ultimately “Rea Farms has proven to be a great school.”

Watson also wrote me back quickly and described himself as a highly involved parent who has served on the parent-teacher groups at a number of schools in his district. Regarding superintendent turnover, he said, “the Board has failed in one of its more critical duties and that is to find and select competent effective leadership for our district.” He believes that one of the reasons for overcrowding in District 6 is that “we aren’t enforcing residency rules strictly enough.” I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 41, Black, Democrat)",1666204742.0,CitizenProfane,"What’s On the Ballot November 8, 2022: South Charlotte (1 of 3 posts) Early voting starts on October 20.

# US Senate

This race is one of the pivotal US Senate races because it could determine which party gets control in 2023. The last two US Senate elections in North Carolina had very narrow margins (e.g. a difference of 96k votes in 2020). As this is a high information race for the leading 2 candidates, **Cheri Beasley** and **Ted Budd,** I did not create a writeup for them. You have likely heard far less about the 2 other candidates in this race who represent the Green and Libertarian Parties: **Matthew Hoh** and **Shannon Bray,** respectively. See [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3qG8eXh8wVElokbfKIjkG9Gj_xvybppsl5Q_Ruxoas/edit?usp=sharing) for more on them.

# US House of Representatives District 14

If you are a Charlotte resident, you are either in District 14 or District 12. District 12 voters will choose between Alma Adams or Tyler Lee (I didn’t include them in this writeup as this is for South Charlotte).  District 14 is a newly formed district after North Carolina gained a congressional seat following the last US census. This district covers much of Mecklenburg and Gaston counties. According to the Cook Political Report, it leans Democrat. District 14 voters will choose between **Pat Harrigan** or **Jeff Jackson.**  Harrigan is a former Green Beret and graduate of West Point but does not appear to be a resident of the district.  Jackson is a former assistant DA for Mecklenburg County and has been a state senator since 2014.  He is “one of the most recognizable politicians in the county.”  For a longer writeup, see [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3qG8eXh8wVElokbfKIjkG9Gj_xvybppsl5Q_Ruxoas/edit?usp=sharing).

## NC State Judges: Supreme Court and Court of Appeals

There are a number of judges on this list who are running for reelection. For more information, see the links[ at the bottom of this WRAL page.](https://www.wral.com/how-to-judge-a-judge-a-guide-for-north-carolina-voters/20498257/)

# NC Supreme Court Associate Justice Seat 3

This is the seat left open by Judge Robin Hudson’s retirement. Hudson actually wrote the opinion in the landmark gerrymandering case a few months ago which overturned the districts that the state legislature drew. There are currently 4 Democrats on the Supreme Court and 3 Republicans so these two open seats are extremely important for both parties.

**Richard Dietz.** Dietz been on the Court of Appeals since 2014 and is now running for a “promotion” to the NC Supreme Court. He was the first in his family to go to college, his mother died when he was younger and he graduated first in his law school class at Wake Forest. He has a passion for civic education—there are animated, explainer videos about the law on his website and he has a web class for AP Government students online as well which he says are to educate “the next generation of lawyers.” Dietz incidentally created some of those videos with conservative NC Supreme Court justice Phil Berger Jr. (also the son of the Republican legislator Phil Berger.).Dietz believes his role as a state judge is to create a body of case law that can help others understand and interpret laws. .He mentions in virtually every interview he’s given that he’s never written a dissent on the Court of Appeals, which he said was a sign of his consensus building. He said his motto is “leadership for our courts.” Dietz is listed as a contributor to the Federalist Society website.

Dietz responded to me quickly and shared additional details beyond what was available on his website including his reflections on leadership which he described as “being able to work with others on a team.” He says that he will bring that collegial attitude toward the Supreme Court. I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 45, White, Republican)

**Lucy Inman.** Inman has also been on the NC Court of Appeals since 2014. She has been a lawyer and judge for 30 years and has “served people in communities large and small.” She says she wants to keep the system “free from partisan politics.” She started her career as a journalist. Local lawyers I know in Charlotte have described her as “excellent” for what that’s worth. In[ this video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H0aFFvYTLE&t=493s) she actually seemed to have a good rapport with her opponent and said that both served on the Court of Appeals together and agreed on 100% of the cases where they both ruled together. Unlike Dietz, she said she has authored dissents, which she believes are important when cases get escalated to the state Supreme Court. She believes that dissents are crucial to standing up for what is right. She lost the election to be an NC Supreme Court Associate Justice in 2020; she received 49.3% of the vote while her opponent received 50.7% (incidentally her opponent was Phil Berger, Jr., a friend of Dietz)

A staffer from Inman’s office responded to me shortly after I had reached out. She gave me, as an example of her impartiality and several examples of “decisions that do not fit the stereotype of my political affiliation as a Democrat.” I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 61, White, Democrat)

# NC Supreme Court Associate Justice Seat 5

**Sam J Ervin IV.** Ervin is the only incumbent on the Supreme Court who is running for a position this year. He was previously on the Court of Appeals from 2009 until he joined the NC Supreme Court. He has been a lawyer for 4 decades. He comes from a family of lawyers and believes “everyone deserves the same chances in life.” He says that every case should start with a blank sheet of paper. He is a graduate of Davidson College and Harvard Law School. He is from Morganton, NC. He cites his mother, who was on the Morganton School Board and led efforts to desegregate schools decades ago, as a big influence on his judicial philosophy.

One of Ervin’s team members responded to me with attachments that he had responded to in other interviews. I gave him an A- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 66, White, Democrat)

**Trey Allen.** Allen has been a lawyer for 22 years and is currently the general counsel for NC Administrative Office of the Courts. He is currently the top lawyer for the state court’s system. He says that he doesn’t like “activist judges” and that he will “follow the text and original understanding of the Constitution.” He cited in an interview that the US Supreme Court justice that he identifies with the most are Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. He cites on his website that he and his wife homeschool their five children. His is a protégé of Paul Newby, currently the Chief Justice of the NC Supreme Court (and who beat Cheri Beasley narrowly in 2020).

I did not hear back from Allen in spite of contacting him twice. He also[ did not respond to any of NC Policy Watch either.](https://ncpolicywatch.com/2022/10/13/policy-watch-interviews-nc-supreme-court-candidates-part-one/) He did however respond to an Observer interview in which he said that video conferencing could make it easier for criminal defendants to connect with their attorneys and to make courts cheaper in general. I gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 47, White, Republican)

# NC Court of Appeals Judge Seat 8

**Julee Tate Flood.** Flood is one of the only candidates running for Court of Appeals who is not currently a sitting judge; she does however have a Ph.D. (“law and policy of higher education”) and works for the Court of Appeals. She has taught law classes at law schools and her website cites “upholding our state and federal constitutions,” “following the rule of law,” and “delivering justice for all” as her key principles. She mentions being a grandmother, as does her opponent.

I emailed her twice but didn’t hear back. I gave her an D for accessibility and responsiveness as she did provide multiple ways to contact her on her website. (White, Republican)

**Carolyn Jennings Thompson.** Thompson has 25 years of experience as a District Court and Superior Court judge. Governor Cooper appointed her in 2018 to a Superior Court judgeship; she became the first African American and first woman to serve the 9th Judicial District. She says she brings “thoughtful preparation, respect and knowledge of the law” to all her cases. She has presided “over thousands of cases” in her past as a judge.

I emailed her twice and did not hear back from her. I gave her an F for accessibility and responsiveness. (Black, Democrat)

## NC Court of Appeals Seat 9

**Brad A. Salmon**. Salmon is currently a district court judge. He also started his own law firm before that with his sister-in-law; it appears to be based near Fayetteville. He was a former state legislator (first elected in 2014, representing Lee and Hartnett counties in the 51st house district) and a graduate of Campbell Law School. He was appointed to his current role by Roy Cooper.

He wrote me back after I emailed him for the second time and sent me information that I didn’t see on his website or in any other interviews. I gave him an A- because of his delayed response to me. He said that “If elected to our Court of Appeals, I will bring experience as a practicing attorney, former lawmaker and sitting trial judge.” He also said that “As a legislator, I held the most conservative district that a Democrat represented when I was in the General Assembly.” He considers himself a political moderate. (White, Democrat)

**Donna Stroud.** Stroud was elected to the Court of Appeals in 2006 and is currently the Chief Judge. She did vote to allow the voter ID case that was passed in an election referendum to stand. (The case was brought in 2020 by, among others, the NAACP and the vote was along party lines with the Republican judges voting to uphold the voter ID law, and the Democratic judge dissenting.) She wanted to be a lawyer since she was in 3rd grade and graduated at the top of her law school class. She did say that she would be deferential to the laws made by state legislatures in[ this debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDDtrfV7vkw). Of the Republican judges, she was the only candidate that I have heard (unofficially, according to my personal contacts) get bipartisan support from Charlotte area lawyers.

Stroud wrote me back within 48 hours. Her responses were thoughtful and appreciative of the election process. I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 58, White, Republican)

# NC Court of Appeals Seat 10

**John M Tyson.** Tyson was elected in 2014 and also served on the Court of Appeals from 2001 to 2009. He calls himself an “advocate of life-long learning”—he received two masters degrees in the middle of his career. He spent several decades in private practice. He is a grandfather. Tyson was accused of “assault with a deadly weapon” for allegedly almost hitting protestors back in May 2021. Those charges were dropped. NC judges do appear to have a mandatory retirement age of 72 and Tyson appears to be nearing that age so it is unclear if elected, he would serve a complete term.

Tyson wrote me back quickly with several links and an attachment to a longer interview he gave. He appears to be a “straight shooter” though many of the links showcased a hard-right conservative leaning which could alienate some independents. He seemed responsive however and candid with his opinions so I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 69, White, Republican)

**Gale Murray Adams.** Adams is a former Navy JAG, and then became an Assistant DA and Assistant Federal Public Defender. She was elected to be a Superior Court judge in Cumberland County (Fayetteville) in 2012. She is a native North Carolinian and mother of 4 children.

Adams wrote me back a day after I initially emailed her with thoughtful and polite responses. She said that she’s been an attorney since 1984 and is in her 9th year as a judge. She spent 8 years as a JAG, 4 as an ADA and 20 as a public defender. She said she is running for the Court of Appeals to “safeguard the rights of citizens, promote independence in our courts and to protect the balance of power.” She said that party politics has no place in judicial elections. I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Black, Democrat)

**NC Court of Appeals Seat 11**

**Darren Jackson.** Jackson is an incumbent on the Court of Appeals. He was appointed to the position in 2020 by Governor Cooper. He was in private practice and a state assemblyman prior. Interesting fact: he and Judge Stroud were former law partners. He pointed out that it was uncommon that two attorneys from the same firm would end up on the Court of Appeals, at the same time. He also served 12 years in the general assembly (until he was appointed to the court presumably) and cited that that would be an asset to his understanding what the legislature intended, which is what the Court of Appeals is often entrusted to do. He graduated from Duke’s law school in 1996 and recently became a grandfather.

Jackson wrote me back immediately. He said he is running because he “loves the law” and has enjoyed his time on the Court of Appeals. He pointed out the importance of experienced, knowledgeable judges. He also pointed me to the full body of decisions he wrote on the NC Courts website. I gave him an A for his prompt and direct responses with some instruction on how I may want to navigate the NC Courts website. (Incumbent, Age 52, White, Democrat)

**Michael J Stading.** Stading is from Mint Hill and was an Air Force JAG. More recently, he was a prosecutor and now is a District Court judge. He said he also had his own private practice and all this experience gives him a “panoramic view” of the trial courtroom which would make him a better judge to “understand cases that are appealed from the trial court level.” He is the father of three.

Stading also wrote me back quickly and provided both a thoughtful response and an invitation for citizens to view him in action any time as he is currently a practicing judge in Mecklenburg County. He said “No judge should ever walk in the courthouse thinking they are going to be the best democrat or republican judge.” Rather, judges should always strive to “provide just results to litigants.” I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness.. (Approx age 41, White, Republican)

# NC Superior Court Judge District 26B Seat 1

Superior Court tackles most criminal felonies (which are often jury trials) and civil cases over $25k.

**Matt Osman.** Osman was elected District Judge 3 times since 2010 (twice uncontested) so this would be a “promotion” for him. He was a former US Navy JAG and he has led an effort to reduce the DWI backlog in Mecklenburg County caused by COVID. He is native Charlottean who graduated from Charlotte Christian School and believes in enforcing the law “as it is written.” His website seems to be fairly moderate and he talks about all sides being heard, though I did see an Instagram ad where he said that victims should be heard and criminals should be held accountable. Has received the endorsement of other local Republicans including Tariq Bokhari and Ed Driggs. Has 3 young children.

Osman asked to have a phone call when I reached out and talked to me for about 30 minutes about his judicial philosophy and experience. He said he is running because he always had a desire to be on the Superior Court and was waiting for the right opportunity. He mentioned that he focused on crime as a topic during the election not only because that was what many of his court cases entailed but also because in conversations with local residents, it seemed to be top of their mind. There are people “concerned they can’t run on the greenway in the middle of the day, concerned about carjackings.” I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (White, Republican)

**Kimberly Best.** Best is a former Spanish teacher and court magistrate. She was a District Court judge for 13 years and just recently was appointed to this role by Governor Cooper in late 2021 so she is the incumbent. She attended Indiana University for law school. She is endorsed by Anthony Fox, former mayor of Charlotte and US Secretary of Transportation as well as nearly 4 dozen other prominent individuals in the Charlotte community (including current and former county commissioners and city council members). She mentions being an “advocate for mental illness and intellectual disability awareness and education.” Best has had the misfortune of receiving some negative media attention in recent months (there appeared to be some drama regarding an acrimonious divorce where there were accusations of domestic violence dating back to 2016 and more recently, she was allegedly involved in an altercation with a truck driver who blocked the entrance to the Mecklenburg Court House.)

She wrote me back within hours of my email outreach with grateful, polite and thorough responses to my questions. Regarding her experience she said she “has presided over every courtroom in the courthouse.” She reinforced many of the points she previously mentioned on her website about her judicial philosophy. She said that she “was a victim of crimes and grew up in a city that was once murder capital of the United States. This experience and my resilience have taught me to know when to be tough and when to show grace.” I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Black, Democrat)

# NC District Court Judge 26 Seats 1 and 13-21

District Court involves misdemeanor criminal charges (eg traffic violations, DWIs) and civil cases under $25k. All of these races are uncontested so I did not reach out to candidates. Brief writeups of the candidates are in [this Google Doc. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3qG8eXh8wVElokbfKIjkG9Gj_xvybppsl5Q_Ruxoas/edit?usp=sharing)

# District Attorney, Clerk of Superior Court and County Sheriff

All of these races are uncontested so I did not reach out to candidates. Brief writeups of the candidates are in [this Google Doc. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3qG8eXh8wVElokbfKIjkG9Gj_xvybppsl5Q_Ruxoas/edit?usp=sharing)

# Board of Commissioners At Large (vote for 3)

Mecklenburg County Commissioners determine the tax rate of county residents and allocate funds for CMS, as well as county-wide services such as courts and parks and recreation.

**Patricia (Pat) Cotham.** Cotham is also an incumbent on the board and has been a fixture in Mecklenburg County politics for years. She has served 5 terms on the board. She seemed to express frustration with CMS in an Observer interview when she said that “CMS has not communicated well and they restrict interaction with us.” She says she has a good relationship with Jeff Jackson and calls herself a “broad-based Democrat” (as opposed to someone focused on a single-issue).

Cotham responded to me soon after I sent her a note through the form field on her website, which was hard to find as her website address is only listed on her Facebook page and leads to a dead link. When I did manage to reach her, her responses were direct. I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness (in spite of a difficult-to-find website) because she responded very quickly. Her responses were terse and direct. (Incumbent, Age 72, White, Democrat)

**Arthur Griffin Jr**. Griffin is a long time civil servant having been previously been the chair of the CMS Board of Education (from 1997 to 2002). He is a retired executive from publishing house McGraw-Hill Education. He believes that absenteeism is a key problem for low-performing CMS schools and proposes quarterly meetings between CMS and other city officials to decrease the achievement gap.

Griffin reached out to me personally responding to my email and in a phone call, he asked that if he did get elected, if I could help address some of the issues I asked about in my outreach to him. I found that to be a rare yet gracious way to engage with his community. He acknowledged that this would be a tough election. He mentioned that his dream for Charlotte would be a “10 minute” neighborhood where all residents had key services available within walking distance. He says he wants to incentivize more construction of vital services like health care near more diverse neighborhoods. He also said that he is not inclined to raise taxes given the increases in property values, but that the county is entrusted with funding many critical services including schools, courts and parks. I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 74, Black, Democrat).

**Tatyana Thulien**. Thulien is a Ukranian immigrant who moved to the US in 1998 and Charlotte in 2011. She has been a singer, journalist and teacher in her time in the US. She says that county residents need to have a “genuine voice for their needs and issues.” She mentioned fair property taxes and public health as two key issues of importance to her. She mentioned being dismayed at the amount of money spent on CMS but without strong results to show for it. She also mentioned that she wants “our faith not to be humiliated and abandoned.” As she grew up in the former Soviet Union, she says that “socialism is not making everyone equal.” She is the mother of two.

I reached out to her a few times and had challenges getting in touch with her. I gave her a C-/D+ for accessibility and responsiveness as a result. (White, Republican)

**Leigh Altman**. Altman is a public interest attorney and an incumbent on the board. She was also an Assistant Attorney General in the state of Georgia many years ago. Altman’s key issues include innovative job initiatives, a strong mental health system, equity in public schools, expanded mass transit options, better funded parks and greenways, LGBTQ rights, a science-based response to the pandemic and transparency in government. She also mentions reducing gun violence. She has talked about women’s reproductive rights issue as well on her website in the past, but that content appears to have been removed.

Altman wrote me back in short but direct sentences soon after I pinged her on her website form field. I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Approx age 50s, White, Democrat)

# Board of Commissioners District 5

**Laura Meier.** Meier is currently serving on the board representing District 5 since 2020. She lists “equitable schools,” “housing” and “parks and recreation” on her website as her areas of advocacy. She also mentions mental health and safe neighborhoods. She is a former teacher of at-risk youths and a graduate of App State University. She was a leader of the Charlotte Women’s March.

She responded to me quickly but seemed skeptical of why I was gathering this information. She responded to me with 3 sentences a few days later. I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness because she provided multiple ways to contact her and she responded quickly but the content of her responses seemed shallow. (Incumbent, Age 53, White, Democrat)

**Matthew Ridenhour.** Ridenhour is a former county commissioner (2012-18) and has run for a number of different public offices since then. He is generally well-regarded as a strong public servant in Mecklenburg County. His website showcases beautiful parks, safe streets and great schools. In an Observer interview, he mentions food deserts and “whether a child has a full stomach” as issues that local government should address. Regarding taxes, he wants a “fair, equitable and transparent revaluation next year.” He also cited defeating the MLS/Memorial Stadium deal which he said would cost taxpayers $100MM. He is the father of two elementary school age children.

Ridenhour wrote me back very quickly and was polite in his tone and responses. I asked him about the single-family zoning changes in Charlotte and he responded that “I lean toward being in favor of removing the single-family zoning, though I would say I only very lightly and cautiously support it.” I also asked him about public charging stations for electric vehicles and he said he wasn’t in favor of using county dollars for it because “those who own electric vehicles—a demographic that tends to be upper middle class or wealthy.” He did however support public electric vehicles for transportation. I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 45, White, Republican)

# Board of Commissioners District 6

Susan Rodriguez-McDowell. She was one of the only commissioners who disagreed with the board about holding back CMS money back in 2021. At the time, that action was viewed as a stunt by many local parents who felt that students would be the biggest losers in that standoff. She did respond to me after a few days but was thoughtful in her response. I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 58, Democrat)

**Jeremy Brasch.** Brasch says he is running to provide choice. He has run twice before for the board of the commission There was very little information about him and I didn’t even see a website. He did however respond immediately to my email and was most vocal when talking about the single family housing zoning changes that were in the news recently (homeowners can now build multifamily units in single family neighborhoods; this is an attempt to relieve housing shortages.) I gave him a B for accessibility and responsiveness, mainly because he appears to have no website. (Age 48, Republican)

**Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education**

This is a non-partisan election though I did cite party affiliation where I found it. CMS has been plagued by a number of issues ranging from low student performance to teacher retention problems to gun incidents and assaults on teachers, as well as missteps in funding allocation, as well as turnover in its superintendent. Nearly everyone who responded to me said that the current Board has failed in its duties.

# CMS Board of Education District 5

This includes Matthews and much of South Charlotte.

**Lisa Cline.** Cline is retired now but was a longtime CMS employees (teacher and assistant principal) who is campaigning on the slogan of “reclaiming education.” Her website has her issues being tackling learning loss, ensuring that graduates are career ready, and creating good communication between parents and schools. While this election is non partisan, Cline is a registered Republican. She said she was involved in the “fight to save Old Providence Park when CMS wanted to build a high school there.”

I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. I wrote her on a Saturday and I received her response back by Monday morning. She offered to also do an in-person meet and greet with me and any other parents I knew if I wanted. She said that her opponent “is supported by a number of public officials, mainly Democrats” and that “I was one of the people who worked long hours with teachers and students to raise the scores” when CMS won the Broad Prize. She says she is the best candidate because she is someone “ who has worked on the East, South, and West sides of Charlotte and was a parent at the same time.” For the full text of her responses, see my spreadsheet and search “Cline.” (Age 62, White, Republican)

**Trent Merchant.** Merchant is a former teacher and theater department director. He is a Charlotte native and his 3 children are or were CMS students. He was a former CMS board member several years ago and says that as “an experienced executive search consultant” he is well-positioned to help the search for the next CMS superintendent. On his website he says that when schools that talk about Jim Crow laws, race-based slavery and secession by the Confederate states, that “is not CRT (critical race theory).” His website had much more comprehensive information that suggested solid insight into current CMS issues. He is currently registered as an unaffiliated voter and is endorsed by a number of current and former city and county elected officials.

I gave Merchant an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. He had multiple ways to contact him on his website and wrote me back without a few hours of my emailing him. He directly answered my questions and had some creative thoughts about the school assignments for the new high school which is in District 5. See the spreadsheet for the full text of his responses. (Age 52, White, Unaffiliated)

# CMS Board of Education District 6

I actually think this was the most competitive district because there is a long-standing incumbent who is broadly respected within the community and his two challenges appear to also be bright, capable, caring individuals. This district includes Ballantyne and Pineville and stretches across the entire southern part of the county.

**Summer Nunn.** Nunn is a mother of 2 CMS children in elementary school and a marketing executive who has worked at a number of regional companies including Red Ventures. She indicates that the board should have parents with children in elementary school which is “45% of our students who are facing very different challenges than they did 5 to 10 years ago.” She serves on her school’s Parent Teacher Leadership team.

When I reached out to her late one evening, she emailed me back the following morning and seemed to be very committed to gathering feedback from the community, particularly on issues like zoning for the new high school in South Charlotte. She said she is “not in favor of censoring materials or teachers' ability to adapt the curriculum to best reach our students just because a parent or a few of them are complaining.” She agrees that CMS has “a leadership problem.” She said that she’s heard from teachers that the leadership changes with the superintendent mean that priorities change which inhibits an idea “to get off the ground or work.” I gave her an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 39, White, Democrat)

**Sean Strain.** Strain is an incumbent on the board and has served since 2017. He lists his priorities as “high expectations and accountability,” “great leaders” and “equity.” He is the father of 4 CMS students. He wants a strong network of neighborhood schools “supplemented by a robust menu of magnet and choice schools.”

Strain was perhaps the most responsive candidate of everyone that I connected with. I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. He is clearly passionate about CMS and has a very strong perspective on where mistakes were made in the past. He believes that he has a reputation as the “voice of reason” and is “not clouded by the various other social issues and agendas that come knocking on a weekly basis.” He said that the Board and the CMS Superintendent need to “stop being politicians” and making political decisions “popular with some of their constituents (e.g., the radical use of age-inappropriate materials in the classroom, lowering standards and expectations for teachers and students)” which was causing the noise. (Incumbent, Age 50, White, Republican)

**Michael Watson.** Watson is the father of 2 CMS high school students. He is an IT professional and a small business owner. The key issues listed on his website are “school safety,” “administrator and teacher retention and recruitment,” “collaboration” and “transparency and communication.” He said that he was originally part of the community discussion around the Rea Farms STEAM program which had concerns from Polo Ridge parents, but ultimately “Rea Farms has proven to be a great school.”

Watson also wrote me back quickly and described himself as a highly involved parent who has served on the parent-teacher groups at a number of schools in his district. Regarding superintendent turnover, he said, “the Board has failed in one of its more critical duties and that is to find and select competent effective leadership for our district.” He believes that one of the reasons for overcrowding in District 6 is that “we aren’t enforcing residency rules strictly enough.” I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness.

What’s On The November 2020 Ballot: South Charlotte,"I’ve been writing summaries of all the candidates for the last few elections. This is designed to help voters with “down ballot” choices. As always, if you have feedback, comments or additional thoughts, please add them in the comments, inform others and share this! 

**US President**

I generally exclude anything about the two main presidential candidates because most voters have plenty of information on them already. That said, there are 3 independent candidates that will appear on the ballot this year in North Carolina. Back in 2016, independent candidates received about 3% of the vote or 189,000 votes (of which the vast majority went to the Libertarian candidate at the time, Gary Johnson). 

**Jo Jorgensen (Libertarian).** Jorgensen is a southerner with degrees from Clemson and SMU, including a PhD earned in 2002 in Industrial and Organizational Psychology. In North Carolina, she actually finished 6th in the Libertarian primary in March with a total of 267 votes (not a typo). Libertarians generally advocate a very low tax platform. Jorgensen’s website also mentions removing quotas on immigration, reducing sentences for “victimless crimes” and preventing arrested individuals from losing their property before due process. 

**Don Blankenship (Constitution).** Blankenship was the former CEO of Massey Energy, a coal company. Most notably, he was convicted in 2015 of “conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards” which was a result of a mine explosion in 2010 that killed 29 coal miners. A federal judge recommended overturning the conviction in 2019. He has run unsuccessfully for Senate in West Virginia in the past. The Constitution Party general advocates for limited the federal government to what is specifically enumerated in the Constitution. Blankenship believes that citizens “cannot rely on the media for truthful information” and “illogical rulings by judges” are major problems. 

**Howie Hawkins (Green).** Hawkins himself is a former Teamster and his VP is the second black woman, in addition to Kamala Harris, who appears at the top of the ballot this year. The Green Party is a far left party that mentions several issues on its website:  $20 minimum wage, reparations for African Americans, and impeaching Trump.  On foreign policy issues, it endorses members of its “core campaign team” who camped outside the Venezuelan embassy to protest “the US sponsored coup attempt.” 

&#x200B;

**US Senate** 

**Thom Tillis (Republican, Incumbent).** Tillis is the incumbent first elected in 2014. He has stayed within party lines supporting Trump and has advocated anti-abortion issues and some anti-Internet marketplace actions (e.g. anti-counterfeit measures, the SANTA Act which forces more accountability on the part of marketplace sellers). His website now leads with a health and COVID message, including a note on his homepage to “hold China accountable.” He supported Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and “the President’s stance on border security.” Tillis was previously speaker of the NC House. In the House, he supported the 2nd Amendment, anti-abortion initiatives and voter ID efforts. He lives in Huntersville. Tillis and the Republican Party have been running a very aggressive (ie negative and laden with attack ads) campaign to prevent Tillis’ seat from flipping. 

**Cal Cunningham (Democrat).** Cunningham has led one of the most well-funded Senate races in NC as this is a critical state for Democrats but also “flippable” based on a history of NC sometimes electing Democratic Senators due changing urban demographics. On his website, Cunningham leads with “lower cost, accessible health care” and is pro-ACA. He is against “reckless tariffs” that hurt farmers and wants a “more equitable economy and living wage in every community.”  On the environment, he would like NC to be carbon neutral by 2050 and to cut carbon and public pollution in half by 2030. He believes investing in wind and solar is the path to best transition the economy. Cunningham also supports a $15 minimum wage. Cunningham talks often about corruption in Washington which he thinks could be overcome with campaign finance reform, fair maps, and “a political system that empowers voters to make their voices heard.” He is anti-dark money and anti-extreme partisan gerrymandering. It also came to light the same weekend the President’s COVID news was revealed that he has been having an affair as “sexual” text messages were discovered (how these came to light is still unclear. It reminds me of the Jeff Bezos sexting scandal which had both hackers and disgruntled individuals involved). 

**Shannon Bray (Libertarian).** Bray’s resume lists that he has a PhD in Computer Science. His website says he works for the Department of Defense but his LinkedIn profile says that his current role is “confidential.”  Bray’s primary message on his website is about privacy (“Who is keeping your private information safe?”) Other issues he explicitly lists are “endless wars,” “data privacy,” “homeland and cybersecurity, “ “veterans affairs” (he served in the Navy), “smart technology” and “home and health care.” He agrees that “the cost of health care has become ridiculous” and says that “tort reform” is key to improving health care quality. 

**Kevin Hayes (Constitution).** Hayes has “15 years experience in the IT industry.” Hayes says that he is anti-federal government in education (which usually means a person is anti-Common Core, but he doesn’t provide any thoughts on how to make up the shortcoming in funds if federal education dollars disappeared).  He has run for office before (US House of Representatives at least twice) and it appears that he hasn’t won an office before.  The Constitution Party is a far right party which focuses on social versus economic issues and espouses many of the same issues as the Republican Party. It leads with the “sanctity of life,” “religious freedom” and “traditional family.”

&#x200B;

**US House of Representatives, District 9**

This district had lots of issues as it was the Dan McCready-Mark Harris district from 2018 (neither of those candidates won the House seat as Dan Bishop ultimately won in a special election).  The respected Cook Political Report has this district as “likely Republican.” 

**Cynthia Wallace (Democrat).** Wallace was the chair of NC Democratic party District 9. Wallace embraces a classic Democratic platform: “good paying jobs,” “affordable healthcare,” “reduced gender pay gap,” “high quality public education,” “improved critical infrastructure” (including roads and Internet). There is actually very little detail beyond a handful of pages on her website. As a new candidate, she won 56% of the vote in the March 2020 primary. She has been vastly outraised financially and we’ve heard little about this race compared to when Dan McCready ran 2 years ago (McCready raised at least $6MM in that race). 

**Dan Bishop (Republican, Incumbent).** Bishop is a reliably conservative politician who was an NC state senator, NC house of representatives member and a county commissioner for years. He won the special election against Dan McCready in 2019 after the state Board of Elections would not certify Mark Harris. Bishop is known for being the “architect of HB2” which is still on the books in NC (in addition to being an anti-transgender bill also prohibits cities like Charlotte from raising its minimum wage). He is unabashedly conservative, against “dangerous sanctuary city policy” and for “expanded school choice” and pro-2nd Amendment. His websites usually also always cite his pro-life stance. He also talks about low taxes and limited government spending.  

&#x200B;

**North Carolina Governor**

**Roy Cooper (Democrat, Incumbent).** Cooper is the incumbent Governor who has served since 2017. He supports pay increases for teachers which stagnated under Republican governors. Education support has a major milestone under Cooper’s leadership. He has been in NC politics for years having served 4 terms as Attorney General. He lists a number of issues on his website ranging from education and the environment to jobs, infrastructure and disaster recovery. Morning Consult’s weekly surveys say that he has a 47% approval rating which is about 30th compared to all 50 states. That figure has fluctuated and has been as high as 59% even as recently as July. 

**Dan Forest (Republican).**  Forest is an architect by training. He has served for two terms as the Lieutenant Governor (2 terms max is what the NC Constitution allows). He is also a very conservative candidate: he supports school choice, was pro HB2 (the anti-transgender bill), has voted against climate change legislation and is anti-gun control. If there is such a thing as Charlotte royalty, Forest is it: he is the son of Sue Myrick, the Congresswoman from District 9 from 1995-2013 and former Charlotte mayor. Forest is reported to have received $2.4 million from a donor who was recently sentenced to 7 years in prison for trying to bribe the insurance commissioner (Mike Causey, who is also on the ballot). Forest has also recently sued Roy Cooper because he disagreed with the Governor’s coronavirus response, a lawsuit which he dropped when a judge ruled against him because he “didn’t have a winning legal argument.” The Observer described his anti-mask stance as “reckless, polarizing and uncaring.” 

**Al Pisano (Constitution).** Pisano is a Pennsylvania native and former CMPD police officer. After incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing he felt that “both parties lacked the Constitutional perspective.” He supports “alternative means of education” like trade schools and homeschooling, eliminating the personal income tax, and not forcing citizens to buy health insurance. He also has a very extreme view of the 2nd Amendment (he thinks that Red Flag laws that “criminalize mental illness” are bad). 

**Steven DiFiore (Libertarian).** DiFiore is a relatively young UNCC graduate (he appears to be around 34). It is unclear if he currently has a job. Online searches reveal that he was a “lighting controls specialist” in his past and is now the recording secretary for Mecklenburg Country’s Libertarian Party.  He leads with a COVID-19 message on his website with a focus on reopening the state, and reducing taxes and liabilities for businesses. His key issues appear to be education (he supports more charter schools), a focus on mental healthcare, and deregulating ABC stores to support the brewing and distilling industry in the state. He ran for Charlotte City Council in 2017 and lost. 

&#x200B;

**NC Lieutentant Governor**

This is an understandably less scrutinized race than governor as the role has less responsibility (even though the salary, $125k, is almost as much as the Governor’s). This role is like the Vice President: it is 2nd in line to the governorship, and it presides over the NC Senate. Both candidates for this role are Black and this would be the first time in North Carolina history that the role would be held by a Black official. The candidates are: 

**Yvonne Lewis Holley (Democrat).**  Holley is from Wake County and has worked during her house tenure (which is now over 7 years) to relieve food deserts. Her key initiative includes the “affordable living initiative” which focuses on affordable and attainable housing, affordable and healthy food, economic and workforce development, transportation, and public education. Since the March primary she has also added criminal justice reform and gun legislation to her website. While many of these sound like issues that city councils may be better equipped to handle than the Lieutenant Governor (given the Lt Gov’s limited role), the issues are critical ones. Holley was endorsed by the Charlotte Observer, the Sierra Club and the NC State AFL-CIO. 

**Mark Robinson (Republican).** Robinson has little political experience and was a surprise winner in the Republican primary in March. He served in the Army reserves and held a number of different jobs as a factory and restaurant shift worker. His claim to fame is that he gave an impassioned speech about conservatism in which he advocated for citizens to own guns to the Greensboro City Council in April 2018. That speech made its way to YouTube and was well-received by conservatives as he critiqued the “loonies on the left.” His platform now is in line with Republicans: anti-abortion, pro-gun control, anti-“indoctrination in schools”, and pro-law enforcement.

&#x200B;

**NC Attorney General**

The NC Attorney General is the top law enforcement officer and top lawyer of the state. According to the NC Department of Justice website, “the Attorney General oversees criminal appeals from state courts to ensure that criminals are kept behind bars and innocent people are not. \[The role\] also ensures that consumers are protected by going after scam artists and corporate bad actors.”

**Josh Stein (Democrat, Incumbent).** Stein has been the Attorney General of NC since 2017. For 7 years prior to that he was a state senator and he worked in the Attorney General’s office before that. His key priorities cited on his website are promoting public safety, protecting consumers and seniors, preserving clean air and water and protecting healthcare including the Affordable Care Act. While his website doesn’t state it, the NC Attorney General’s office has also joined in the broad antitrust investigations that many states are undertaking now into Google, Facebook and others. Stein has been endorsed by the Observer, the AFL-CIO, Governor Roy Cooper and Planned Parenthood NC. 

**Jim O’Neill (Republican).**  O’Neill served as Forsyth County District Attorney since 2009. He ran for NC District Attorney in 2016 and lost the primary.  His website is very minimalist now but he has said in the past he will address the backlog of sexual assault kits that are with the state (his opponent is accusing him in ads that Forsyth County now has a huge backlog). He supports federal immigration policy (he supports ICE) and does not support sanctuary cities, and he says he will fight the opioid crisis. He is also an advocate of the death penalty. 

&#x200B;

**NC Auditor**

This role has oversight for the accounting and financial functions of the state. It also acts as a watchdog over state agencies so it requires candidates with strong accounting skills. 

**Beth Wood (Democrat, Incumbent).** Wood is running for her 4th term as the state auditor (she’s been in the role since 2009). She has been in the role for years and appears to be well-regarded. She has a degree in accounting and is a CPA.  She has a reputation of doing her job well and the Observer has endorsed her. On her website, she says she’s saved the NC millions of dollars by auditing things like prison medical billing and employee reviews. She has introduced data analytics into the office in order to more quickly find dollars at risk.  

**Tony Street (Republican).** Street is from Brunswick County (east coast, Wilmington area) and has worked in nuclear security and commercial fishing and has operated a small business. He says he has a master’s in public administration from UNC Pembroke. He also has a criminal record having served 6 months probation for stalking. He says he wants ensure voters know how their money is spent but it is not clear that he has any accounting qualifications which seem to be essential to executing this role. He describes himself on his website as a “fiscal, moral and social conservative.”

&#x200B;

**NC Commissioner of Agriculture**

This role exists to find “new markets” for NC farm products, preserve working farms and protect the state’s food supply. The role is currently held by a Republican and is elected every 4 years. This role also manages weights and measures, gas and oil inspection and operates the NC State Fair and state farmers markets. The salary is $125k. 

**Steve Troxler (Republican, Incumbent).** Troxler has been in this role since 2005. His website leads with commentary denouncing Jenna Wadsworth, his opponent, wishing that “God would change her heart” (she posted a TikTok video that was critical of Trump). His plan for the future includes keeping the food supply abundant, keeping the food supply safe and maintaining healthy forests and conservation. He was endorsed by the Charlotte Observer. 

**Jenna Wadsworth (Democrat).** Wadsworth was elected to be the Wake County Soil and Water Conservation District Board of Supervisors while she was still in college. She is in her early 30s now. She is from the Triangle area, having attended North Carolina School of Science and Math for high school and NC State for college. She grew up on a farm and her key issues are farmland preservation, not just “writing relief checks.” She supports hemp and cannabis as new crops and is endorsed by NC AFL-CIO and NC Sierra Club. . ”Wadsworth is young and received kudos in a Charlotte Observer op-ed for being passionate about agriculture.  But while the Observer was complimentary about her ideas and energy, it gave its endorsement to the incumbent Troxler because of his long-standing relationship with farmers, which it felt was important due to agriculture’s role in NC’s economy. 

&#x200B;

**NC Commissioner of Insurance**

This role regulates the insurance industry in North Carolina, licenses insurance professionals, educations customers about insurance and handles customer complaints about insurance. The salary is $125k.

**Mike Causey (Republican, Incumbent).** Causey is the incumbent and the State Fire Marshal. He’s an Army veteran and worked in the insurance industry for 25 years. His website says his “goal as commissioner is to fight for more competition in the industry and to combat insurance fraud to drive rates lower for the North Carolina consumer.  He is also passionate about making the office more consumer-friendly to help residents attain their insurance needs.” Causey is currently embroiled in the same scandal as Dan Forest who is accused of accepting funds from a wealthy donor who is now accused of bribery. Causey was evidently an FBI informant in that case. 

**Wayne Goodwin (Democrat).** Goodwin is a native North Carolinian and was the former Insurance Commissioner (elected in both 2008 and 2012 but was defeated by Mike Causey in 2016). He is also currently the chair of the state Democratic party. He says that during his tenure as insurance commissioner, NC residents had the lowest auto insurance rates in the country but that is no longer the case. He calls his opponent “#RateHikeMike.” 

&#x200B;

**NC Commissioner of Labor** 

This winner of this position will have their photo on every elevator in NC. The current commissioner, Cherie Berry has had a reputation of being soft on employers who violate labor laws. This position also does a number of other important as well things like inspect amusement park rides and investigate employment discrimination. 

**Josh Dobson (Republican).** Dobson is currently a state representative and also a former county commissioner. He appears to have raised more money in this race than his opponents. He also doesn’t think this role should be “on a crusade” to prosecute businesses. He has the endorsement of NC Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler and NC Congressman Mark Meadows. 

**Jessica Holmes (Democrat).** Holmes was elected to the Wake County Board of Commissioners in her 20s.  She is a native North Carolinian and a first generation college graduate.  She considers herself a ""worker's advocate.""  It’s important to note that if Holmes and Holley are elected, there would be 2 Black women who are senior in the NC “Council of State” (10 elected state-level positions, including all of the ones on this ballot). 

&#x200B;

**NC Secretary of State**

This role is the head the economic and business-related operations of the state. 

**EC Sykes (Republican).** Sykes says he wants to help NC by “bringing transparency and efficiency to our state government with commonsense policies like honoring the rule of law, cutting waste, limiting the size of government, and restoring citizens’ confidence in our government.” His homepage announces that he is “a man of strong faith.” He was a former Ted Cruz campaign volunteer. He does not appear to have any political background but does have a business background. He cites one of his objectives in an Observer interview to “end the practice of allowing illegal aliens to serve as Notaries Public.”  

**Elaine Marshall (Democrat, Incumbent).** Marshall has been the secretary of state for NC since 1996 when she was the first woman elected to the Council of State in NC’s history. She was an NC state senator prior to that. She says that her key accomplishments have been to “cut red tape for entrepreneurs” and “prosecute charities masquerading as charities.”  During the pandemic, Marshall said one of the things the office did was to have a 24/7 “online services” to help small businesses get PPP loans. She has also cited cybersecurity (ensuring the office’s data is safe) as a concern in written interviews. 

&#x200B;

**NC Superintendent of Public Education**

This person will be a member of the state Board of Education. 

**Catherine Truitt (Republican).** Truitt is a lifelong educator and was an education advisor to Pat McCrory. She is also now the Chancellor of Western Governors University North Carolina. The issues of importance to her are to have qualified teachers in all classrooms, ensure graduates are college and career-ready, and engage public-private partnerships for schools. In the primary, Truitt downplayed her position on vouchers but in this election, she has been more clear that she aligns with the Republican party on this issue and is very pro-voucher. This of course is a position that teacher’s unions and Democrats are against. She does not say anything about reopening schools or safety protocols for schools in the midst of COVID-19. 

**Jen Mangrum (Democrat).** Mangrum is also a longtime educator having been an elementary school teacher for nearly 14 years. She was on the education faculty at NC State where she created the Elementary Education Department there and she is now an Associate Professor at UNC Greensboro. Her key platform elements include expanding funding for classrooms, securing a living wage for personnel and getting spend for digital resources. On her website she shares the findings of a task force she pulled together of teachers giving their recommendations on reopening schools (essentially, a significant amount of funding needed to ensure safety and equity). She is endorsed by the Observer. 

&#x200B;

**NC Treasurer**

 The treasurer’s office “manages the state’s retirement system, investments, and unclaimed property and provides financial support to local governments.” This includes pension plans, debt issuance, 401k plans and the state’s disability program.  The position is currently held by a Republican and elected every four years.  

**Ronnie Chatterji (Democrat).** Chatterji is an associate professor at Duke’s Business School and previously served as a Senior Economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisors where he was involved with policies related to “innovation, entrepreurship, infrastructure and economic growth.” He says that climate change is important but it’s unclear how he would change the current investment approach to address that. Many of his tweets include #TheNerdWeNeed. In the March primary, he was endorsed by the AFL-CIO and the NC Association of Educators.

**Dale Folwell (Republican, Incumbent).** Folwell was a private investor and financial advisor who has served in the NC House and is the current Treasurer of North Carolina. He is endorsed by the Observer though it didn’t provide much detail for why beyond “we think he’s the right fit in this challenging financial climate” in spite of the fact that he hasn’t had much success “pushing for more transparency in hospital pricing.” 

&#x200B;

**NC State Senate District 37**

The NC House and Senate have been majority Republican since 2011. They were in Democratic hands for 12 years from 1999 through 2010. This will likely vary for you unless you live in my neighborhood because these lines were redrawn since the 2016 election. To see which district is yours, you can click [here](https://www.ncleg.gov/FindYourLegislators): 

**Jeff Jackson (Democrat, Incumbent).** Jackson is the former assistant DA for Mceklenburg County and has been a state senator since 2014.

**Sonja Nichols (Republican).** Nichols is the owner of a security firm in Charlotte. She has said in questionnaires that her goals are to be “pro business,” enable “affordable housing and health care” and support “social equity.” She wishes that NC could have manufactured more things needed for COVID-19 like masks and test kits early in the pandemic. She is a Black Republican and “new to politics.” 

**Jeff Scott (Libertarian).** Jeff Scott is relatively new to the North Carolina region and he has run for a number of roles unsuccessfully in the past including US Congressman and City Council. All of his digital footprint now is still from last year’s special election for District 9 (which Dan Bishop won) and there is nothing he has posted for his candidacy now. His old website calls for reform of predatory student lending, to stop “our search for monsters abroad,” and to stop nationalizing health care. 

&#x200B;

The board's major responsibilities include adopting the annual county budget, setting the county property tax rate, and assessing and establishing priorities on the many community needs, especially those related to health, education, welfare, mental health, and the environment. The board also makes appointments to citizen advisory committees.

There are 9 Commissioners. The 3 at-large contestants are running uncontested:

**Ella Scarborough (Democrat, Incumbent).** Scarborough is an incumbent. She has left little to no digital footprint of her positions yet she has served in local politics in some role (first as a city councilwoman in 1987) for many years. She was Charlotte's first Black councilwoman in 1987.

**Matthew Ridenhour (Republican).** Ridenhour lives in South Charlotte and had served on the Mecklenburg County Commission in the past but was defeated in 2018 all Republicans were evicted from the County Commission. He then ran for District 9 Congressman in the special election in 2019 and lost in the primary to Dan Bishop.  He is a military veteran and well-respected by city officials and was endorsed by Robert Pittinger who previously held this congressional seat. Many of Ridenhour’s positions are standard conservative issues (e.g. pro life, pro wall). 

**Laura Meier (Democrat).** Meier is a former high school teacher for CMS and director of Sedgefield Middle’s after school program, and Dilworth resident. She has volunteered in other political campaigns and events like the 2017 Charlotte Women’s March.

She says “we must provide equitable access to our local parks so that all have the chance for green spaces for the sake of mental health.” 

&#x200B;

**Register of Deeds** 

**Fred Smith (Democrat).** Smith was first elected to this role in 2016 when he defeated the then incumbent. The office stores real estate documents and issues marriage licenses. 

&#x200B;

**Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor** 

The role is best for a “committed conservationist” according to the org’s website. The non-paid board of supervisors meets monthly to establish local soil and water conservation priorities based on the needs of the district. For years, this role has attracted many quirky candidates and this year is no exception: 

**David Michael Rice.**  Rice is a perennial candidate for some role or another. He last ran for mayor against Vi Lyles in 2019 and in 2018 ran for this same role unsuccessfully (he finished 4th of 6 candidates at that time). He appears to be registered as a Republican in Mecklenburg County.

&#x200B;

**Voters are also being asked to vote on 3 referenda:**

· $100MM transportation bond

· $50MM housing bond

· $45MM neighborhood improvement bond

Jennifer Roberts, the former major of Charlotte, wrote an op-ed in the Observer on September 15 questioning the lack of details or information on the bonds. She actually demanded that the city give more detail. To see if the bonds may affect you, look at p21-25 of [this link](https://charlottenc.gov/budget/FY2021/adobted/FY2021_Adopted_Budget_Book-Final_Draft.pdf). There is some detail but not much. That said, the city budget for the coming year appears to be $2.5B. This year the city will spend $230MM servicing its debt.",1602040008.0,CitizenProfane,"What’s On The November 2020 Ballot: South Charlotte I’ve been writing summaries of all the candidates for the last few elections. This is designed to help voters with “down ballot” choices. As always, if you have feedback, comments or additional thoughts, please add them in the comments, inform others and share this! 

**US President**

I generally exclude anything about the two main presidential candidates because most voters have plenty of information on them already. That said, there are 3 independent candidates that will appear on the ballot this year in North Carolina. Back in 2016, independent candidates received about 3% of the vote or 189,000 votes (of which the vast majority went to the Libertarian candidate at the time, Gary Johnson). 

**Jo Jorgensen (Libertarian).** Jorgensen is a southerner with degrees from Clemson and SMU, including a PhD earned in 2002 in Industrial and Organizational Psychology. In North Carolina, she actually finished 6th in the Libertarian primary in March with a total of 267 votes (not a typo). Libertarians generally advocate a very low tax platform. Jorgensen’s website also mentions removing quotas on immigration, reducing sentences for “victimless crimes” and preventing arrested individuals from losing their property before due process. 

**Don Blankenship (Constitution).** Blankenship was the former CEO of Massey Energy, a coal company. Most notably, he was convicted in 2015 of “conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards” which was a result of a mine explosion in 2010 that killed 29 coal miners. A federal judge recommended overturning the conviction in 2019. He has run unsuccessfully for Senate in West Virginia in the past. The Constitution Party general advocates for limited the federal government to what is specifically enumerated in the Constitution. Blankenship believes that citizens “cannot rely on the media for truthful information” and “illogical rulings by judges” are major problems. 

**Howie Hawkins (Green).** Hawkins himself is a former Teamster and his VP is the second black woman, in addition to Kamala Harris, who appears at the top of the ballot this year. The Green Party is a far left party that mentions several issues on its website:  $20 minimum wage, reparations for African Americans, and impeaching Trump.  On foreign policy issues, it endorses members of its “core campaign team” who camped outside the Venezuelan embassy to protest “the US sponsored coup attempt.” 

&#x200B;

**US Senate** 

**Thom Tillis (Republican, Incumbent).** Tillis is the incumbent first elected in 2014. He has stayed within party lines supporting Trump and has advocated anti-abortion issues and some anti-Internet marketplace actions (e.g. anti-counterfeit measures, the SANTA Act which forces more accountability on the part of marketplace sellers). His website now leads with a health and COVID message, including a note on his homepage to “hold China accountable.” He supported Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and “the President’s stance on border security.” Tillis was previously speaker of the NC House. In the House, he supported the 2nd Amendment, anti-abortion initiatives and voter ID efforts. He lives in Huntersville. Tillis and the Republican Party have been running a very aggressive (ie negative and laden with attack ads) campaign to prevent Tillis’ seat from flipping. 

**Cal Cunningham (Democrat).** Cunningham has led one of the most well-funded Senate races in NC as this is a critical state for Democrats but also “flippable” based on a history of NC sometimes electing Democratic Senators due changing urban demographics. On his website, Cunningham leads with “lower cost, accessible health care” and is pro-ACA. He is against “reckless tariffs” that hurt farmers and wants a “more equitable economy and living wage in every community.”  On the environment, he would like NC to be carbon neutral by 2050 and to cut carbon and public pollution in half by 2030. He believes investing in wind and solar is the path to best transition the economy. Cunningham also supports a $15 minimum wage. Cunningham talks often about corruption in Washington which he thinks could be overcome with campaign finance reform, fair maps, and “a political system that empowers voters to make their voices heard.” He is anti-dark money and anti-extreme partisan gerrymandering. It also came to light the same weekend the President’s COVID news was revealed that he has been having an affair as “sexual” text messages were discovered (how these came to light is still unclear. It reminds me of the Jeff Bezos sexting scandal which had both hackers and disgruntled individuals involved). 

**Shannon Bray (Libertarian).** Bray’s resume lists that he has a PhD in Computer Science. His website says he works for the Department of Defense but his LinkedIn profile says that his current role is “confidential.”  Bray’s primary message on his website is about privacy (“Who is keeping your private information safe?”) Other issues he explicitly lists are “endless wars,” “data privacy,” “homeland and cybersecurity, “ “veterans affairs” (he served in the Navy), “smart technology” and “home and health care.” He agrees that “the cost of health care has become ridiculous” and says that “tort reform” is key to improving health care quality. 

**Kevin Hayes (Constitution).** Hayes has “15 years experience in the IT industry.” Hayes says that he is anti-federal government in education (which usually means a person is anti-Common Core, but he doesn’t provide any thoughts on how to make up the shortcoming in funds if federal education dollars disappeared).  He has run for office before (US House of Representatives at least twice) and it appears that he hasn’t won an office before.  The Constitution Party is a far right party which focuses on social versus economic issues and espouses many of the same issues as the Republican Party. It leads with the “sanctity of life,” “religious freedom” and “traditional family.”

&#x200B;

**US House of Representatives, District 9**

This district had lots of issues as it was the Dan McCready-Mark Harris district from 2018 (neither of those candidates won the House seat as Dan Bishop ultimately won in a special election).  The respected Cook Political Report has this district as “likely Republican.” 

**Cynthia Wallace (Democrat).** Wallace was the chair of NC Democratic party District 9. Wallace embraces a classic Democratic platform: “good paying jobs,” “affordable healthcare,” “reduced gender pay gap,” “high quality public education,” “improved critical infrastructure” (including roads and Internet). There is actually very little detail beyond a handful of pages on her website. As a new candidate, she won 56% of the vote in the March 2020 primary. She has been vastly outraised financially and we’ve heard little about this race compared to when Dan McCready ran 2 years ago (McCready raised at least $6MM in that race). 

**Dan Bishop (Republican, Incumbent).** Bishop is a reliably conservative politician who was an NC state senator, NC house of representatives member and a county commissioner for years. He won the special election against Dan McCready in 2019 after the state Board of Elections would not certify Mark Harris. Bishop is known for being the “architect of HB2” which is still on the books in NC (in addition to being an anti-transgender bill also prohibits cities like Charlotte from raising its minimum wage). He is unabashedly conservative, against “dangerous sanctuary city policy” and for “expanded school choice” and pro-2nd Amendment. His websites usually also always cite his pro-life stance. He also talks about low taxes and limited government spending.  

&#x200B;

**North Carolina Governor**

**Roy Cooper (Democrat, Incumbent).** Cooper is the incumbent Governor who has served since 2017. He supports pay increases for teachers which stagnated under Republican governors. Education support has a major milestone under Cooper’s leadership. He has been in NC politics for years having served 4 terms as Attorney General. He lists a number of issues on his website ranging from education and the environment to jobs, infrastructure and disaster recovery. Morning Consult’s weekly surveys say that he has a 47% approval rating which is about 30th compared to all 50 states. That figure has fluctuated and has been as high as 59% even as recently as July. 

**Dan Forest (Republican).**  Forest is an architect by training. He has served for two terms as the Lieutenant Governor (2 terms max is what the NC Constitution allows). He is also a very conservative candidate: he supports school choice, was pro HB2 (the anti-transgender bill), has voted against climate change legislation and is anti-gun control. If there is such a thing as Charlotte royalty, Forest is it: he is the son of Sue Myrick, the Congresswoman from District 9 from 1995-2013 and former Charlotte mayor. Forest is reported to have received $2.4 million from a donor who was recently sentenced to 7 years in prison for trying to bribe the insurance commissioner (Mike Causey, who is also on the ballot). Forest has also recently sued Roy Cooper because he disagreed with the Governor’s coronavirus response, a lawsuit which he dropped when a judge ruled against him because he “didn’t have a winning legal argument.” The Observer described his anti-mask stance as “reckless, polarizing and uncaring.” 

**Al Pisano (Constitution).** Pisano is a Pennsylvania native and former CMPD police officer. After incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing he felt that “both parties lacked the Constitutional perspective.” He supports “alternative means of education” like trade schools and homeschooling, eliminating the personal income tax, and not forcing citizens to buy health insurance. He also has a very extreme view of the 2nd Amendment (he thinks that Red Flag laws that “criminalize mental illness” are bad). 

**Steven DiFiore (Libertarian).** DiFiore is a relatively young UNCC graduate (he appears to be around 34). It is unclear if he currently has a job. Online searches reveal that he was a “lighting controls specialist” in his past and is now the recording secretary for Mecklenburg Country’s Libertarian Party.  He leads with a COVID-19 message on his website with a focus on reopening the state, and reducing taxes and liabilities for businesses. His key issues appear to be education (he supports more charter schools), a focus on mental healthcare, and deregulating ABC stores to support the brewing and distilling industry in the state. He ran for Charlotte City Council in 2017 and lost. 

&#x200B;

**NC Lieutentant Governor**

This is an understandably less scrutinized race than governor as the role has less responsibility (even though the salary, $125k, is almost as much as the Governor’s). This role is like the Vice President: it is 2nd in line to the governorship, and it presides over the NC Senate. Both candidates for this role are Black and this would be the first time in North Carolina history that the role would be held by a Black official. The candidates are: 

**Yvonne Lewis Holley (Democrat).**  Holley is from Wake County and has worked during her house tenure (which is now over 7 years) to relieve food deserts. Her key initiative includes the “affordable living initiative” which focuses on affordable and attainable housing, affordable and healthy food, economic and workforce development, transportation, and public education. Since the March primary she has also added criminal justice reform and gun legislation to her website. While many of these sound like issues that city councils may be better equipped to handle than the Lieutenant Governor (given the Lt Gov’s limited role), the issues are critical ones. Holley was endorsed by the Charlotte Observer, the Sierra Club and the NC State AFL-CIO. 

**Mark Robinson (Republican).** Robinson has little political experience and was a surprise winner in the Republican primary in March. He served in the Army reserves and held a number of different jobs as a factory and restaurant shift worker. His claim to fame is that he gave an impassioned speech about conservatism in which he advocated for citizens to own guns to the Greensboro City Council in April 2018. That speech made its way to YouTube and was well-received by conservatives as he critiqued the “loonies on the left.” His platform now is in line with Republicans: anti-abortion, pro-gun control, anti-“indoctrination in schools”, and pro-law enforcement.

&#x200B;

**NC Attorney General**

The NC Attorney General is the top law enforcement officer and top lawyer of the state. According to the NC Department of Justice website, “the Attorney General oversees criminal appeals from state courts to ensure that criminals are kept behind bars and innocent people are not. \[The role\] also ensures that consumers are protected by going after scam artists and corporate bad actors.”

**Josh Stein (Democrat, Incumbent).** Stein has been the Attorney General of NC since 2017. For 7 years prior to that he was a state senator and he worked in the Attorney General’s office before that. His key priorities cited on his website are promoting public safety, protecting consumers and seniors, preserving clean air and water and protecting healthcare including the Affordable Care Act. While his website doesn’t state it, the NC Attorney General’s office has also joined in the broad antitrust investigations that many states are undertaking now into Google, Facebook and others. Stein has been endorsed by the Observer, the AFL-CIO, Governor Roy Cooper and Planned Parenthood NC. 

**Jim O’Neill (Republican).**  O’Neill served as Forsyth County District Attorney since 2009. He ran for NC District Attorney in 2016 and lost the primary.  His website is very minimalist now but he has said in the past he will address the backlog of sexual assault kits that are with the state (his opponent is accusing him in ads that Forsyth County now has a huge backlog). He supports federal immigration policy (he supports ICE) and does not support sanctuary cities, and he says he will fight the opioid crisis. He is also an advocate of the death penalty. 

&#x200B;

**NC Auditor**

This role has oversight for the accounting and financial functions of the state. It also acts as a watchdog over state agencies so it requires candidates with strong accounting skills. 

**Beth Wood (Democrat, Incumbent).** Wood is running for her 4th term as the state auditor (she’s been in the role since 2009). She has been in the role for years and appears to be well-regarded. She has a degree in accounting and is a CPA.  She has a reputation of doing her job well and the Observer has endorsed her. On her website, she says she’s saved the NC millions of dollars by auditing things like prison medical billing and employee reviews. She has introduced data analytics into the office in order to more quickly find dollars at risk.  

**Tony Street (Republican).** Street is from Brunswick County (east coast, Wilmington area) and has worked in nuclear security and commercial fishing and has operated a small business. He says he has a master’s in public administration from UNC Pembroke. He also has a criminal record having served 6 months probation for stalking. He says he wants ensure voters know how their money is spent but it is not clear that he has any accounting qualifications which seem to be essential to executing this role. He describes himself on his website as a “fiscal, moral and social conservative.”

&#x200B;

**NC Commissioner of Agriculture**

This role exists to find “new markets” for NC farm products, preserve working farms and protect the state’s food supply. The role is currently held by a Republican and is elected every 4 years. This role also manages weights and measures, gas and oil inspection and operates the NC State Fair and state farmers markets. The salary is $125k. 

**Steve Troxler (Republican, Incumbent).** Troxler has been in this role since 2005. His website leads with commentary denouncing Jenna Wadsworth, his opponent, wishing that “God would change her heart” (she posted a TikTok video that was critical of Trump). His plan for the future includes keeping the food supply abundant, keeping the food supply safe and maintaining healthy forests and conservation. He was endorsed by the Charlotte Observer. 

**Jenna Wadsworth (Democrat).** Wadsworth was elected to be the Wake County Soil and Water Conservation District Board of Supervisors while she was still in college. She is in her early 30s now. She is from the Triangle area, having attended North Carolina School of Science and Math for high school and NC State for college. She grew up on a farm and her key issues are farmland preservation, not just “writing relief checks.” She supports hemp and cannabis as new crops and is endorsed by NC AFL-CIO and NC Sierra Club. . ”Wadsworth is young and received kudos in a Charlotte Observer op-ed for being passionate about agriculture.  But while the Observer was complimentary about her ideas and energy, it gave its endorsement to the incumbent Troxler because of his long-standing relationship with farmers, which it felt was important due to agriculture’s role in NC’s economy. 

&#x200B;

**NC Commissioner of Insurance**

This role regulates the insurance industry in North Carolina, licenses insurance professionals, educations customers about insurance and handles customer complaints about insurance. The salary is $125k.

**Mike Causey (Republican, Incumbent).** Causey is the incumbent and the State Fire Marshal. He’s an Army veteran and worked in the insurance industry for 25 years. His website says his “goal as commissioner is to fight for more competition in the industry and to combat insurance fraud to drive rates lower for the North Carolina consumer.  He is also passionate about making the office more consumer-friendly to help residents attain their insurance needs.” Causey is currently embroiled in the same scandal as Dan Forest who is accused of accepting funds from a wealthy donor who is now accused of bribery. Causey was evidently an FBI informant in that case. 

**Wayne Goodwin (Democrat).** Goodwin is a native North Carolinian and was the former Insurance Commissioner (elected in both 2008 and 2012 but was defeated by Mike Causey in 2016). He is also currently the chair of the state Democratic party. He says that during his tenure as insurance commissioner, NC residents had the lowest auto insurance rates in the country but that is no longer the case. He calls his opponent “#RateHikeMike.” 

&#x200B;

**NC Commissioner of Labor** 

This winner of this position will have their photo on every elevator in NC. The current commissioner, Cherie Berry has had a reputation of being soft on employers who violate labor laws. This position also does a number of other important as well things like inspect amusement park rides and investigate employment discrimination. 

**Josh Dobson (Republican).** Dobson is currently a state representative and also a former county commissioner. He appears to have raised more money in this race than his opponents. He also doesn’t think this role should be “on a crusade” to prosecute businesses. He has the endorsement of NC Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler and NC Congressman Mark Meadows. 

**Jessica Holmes (Democrat).** Holmes was elected to the Wake County Board of Commissioners in her 20s.  She is a native North Carolinian and a first generation college graduate.  She considers herself a ""worker's advocate.""  It’s important to note that if Holmes and Holley are elected, there would be 2 Black women who are senior in the NC “Council of State” (10 elected state-level positions, including all of the ones on this ballot). 

&#x200B;

**NC Secretary of State**

This role is the head the economic and business-related operations of the state. 

**EC Sykes (Republican).** Sykes says he wants to help NC by “bringing transparency and efficiency to our state government with commonsense policies like honoring the rule of law, cutting waste, limiting the size of government, and restoring citizens’ confidence in our government.” His homepage announces that he is “a man of strong faith.” He was a former Ted Cruz campaign volunteer. He does not appear to have any political background but does have a business background. He cites one of his objectives in an Observer interview to “end the practice of allowing illegal aliens to serve as Notaries Public.”  

**Elaine Marshall (Democrat, Incumbent).** Marshall has been the secretary of state for NC since 1996 when she was the first woman elected to the Council of State in NC’s history. She was an NC state senator prior to that. She says that her key accomplishments have been to “cut red tape for entrepreneurs” and “prosecute charities masquerading as charities.”  During the pandemic, Marshall said one of the things the office did was to have a 24/7 “online services” to help small businesses get PPP loans. She has also cited cybersecurity (ensuring the office’s data is safe) as a concern in written interviews. 

&#x200B;

**NC Superintendent of Public Education**

This person will be a member of the state Board of Education. 

**Catherine Truitt (Republican).** Truitt is a lifelong educator and was an education advisor to Pat McCrory. She is also now the Chancellor of Western Governors University North Carolina. The issues of importance to her are to have qualified teachers in all classrooms, ensure graduates are college and career-ready, and engage public-private partnerships for schools. In the primary, Truitt downplayed her position on vouchers but in this election, she has been more clear that she aligns with the Republican party on this issue and is very pro-voucher. This of course is a position that teacher’s unions and Democrats are against. She does not say anything about reopening schools or safety protocols for schools in the midst of COVID-19. 

**Jen Mangrum (Democrat).** Mangrum is also a longtime educator having been an elementary school teacher for nearly 14 years. She was on the education faculty at NC State where she created the Elementary Education Department there and she is now an Associate Professor at UNC Greensboro. Her key platform elements include expanding funding for classrooms, securing a living wage for personnel and getting spend for digital resources. On her website she shares the findings of a task force she pulled together of teachers giving their recommendations on reopening schools (essentially, a significant amount of funding needed to ensure safety and equity). She is endorsed by the Observer. 

&#x200B;

**NC Treasurer**

 The treasurer’s office “manages the state’s retirement system, investments, and unclaimed property and provides financial support to local governments.” This includes pension plans, debt issuance, 401k plans and the state’s disability program.  The position is currently held by a Republican and elected every four years.  

**Ronnie Chatterji (Democrat).** Chatterji is an associate professor at Duke’s Business School and previously served as a Senior Economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisors where he was involved with policies related to “innovation, entrepreurship, infrastructure and economic growth.” He says that climate change is important but it’s unclear how he would change the current investment approach to address that. Many of his tweets include #TheNerdWeNeed. In the March primary, he was endorsed by the AFL-CIO and the NC Association of Educators.

**Dale Folwell (Republican, Incumbent).** Folwell was a private investor and financial advisor who has served in the NC House and is the current Treasurer of North Carolina. He is endorsed by the Observer though it didn’t provide much detail for why beyond “we think he’s the right fit in this challenging financial climate” in spite of the fact that he hasn’t had much success “pushing for more transparency in hospital pricing.” 

&#x200B;

**NC State Senate District 37**

The NC House and Senate have been majority Republican since 2011. They were in Democratic hands for 12 years from 1999 through 2010. This will likely vary for you unless you live in my neighborhood because these lines were redrawn since the 2016 election. To see which district is yours, you can click [here](https://www.ncleg.gov/FindYourLegislators): 

**Jeff Jackson (Democrat, Incumbent).** Jackson is the former assistant DA for Mceklenburg County and has been a state senator since 2014.

He is one of the few candidates with bilingual links/translations on his website. 

**Sonja Nichols (Republican).** Nichols is the owner of a security firm in Charlotte. She has said in questionnaires that her goals are to be “pro business,” enable “affordable housing and health care” and support “social equity.” She wishes that NC could have manufactured more things needed for COVID-19 like masks and test kits early in the pandemic. She is a Black Republican and “new to politics.” 

**Jeff Scott (Libertarian).** Jeff Scott is relatively new to the North Carolina region and he has run for a number of roles unsuccessfully in the past including US Congressman and City Council. All of his digital footprint now is still from last year’s special election for District 9 (which Dan Bishop won) and there is nothing he has posted for his candidacy now. His old website calls for reform of predatory student lending, to stop “our search for monsters abroad,” and to stop nationalizing health care. 

&#x200B;

**NC House of Representatives District 104**

**Don Pomeroy (Republican).** Pomeroy appears to be new to politics but cites “30+ years of business, financial and volunteer experience.” He says he was a CPA and then a C-suite executive.

The board also makes appointments to citizen advisory committees.

There are 9 Commissioners. The 3 at-large contestants are running uncontested:

**Ella Scarborough (Democrat, Incumbent).** Scarborough is an incumbent. She has left little to no digital footprint of her positions yet she has served in local politics in some role (first as a city councilwoman in 1987) for many years. She was Charlotte's first Black councilwoman in 1987.

**Matthew Ridenhour (Republican).** Ridenhour lives in South Charlotte and had served on the Mecklenburg County Commission in the past but was defeated in 2018 all Republicans were evicted from the County Commission.

She has volunteered in other political campaigns and events like the 2017 Charlotte Women’s March.

**Fred Smith (Democrat).** Smith was first elected to this role in 2016 when he defeated the then incumbent. The office stores real estate documents and issues marriage licenses. 

&#x200B;

**Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor** 

The role is best for a “committed conservationist” according to the org’s website. The non-paid board of supervisors meets monthly to establish local soil and water conservation priorities based on the needs of the district. For years, this role has attracted many quirky candidates and this year is no exception: 

**David Michael Rice.**  Rice is a perennial candidate for some role or another. He last ran for mayor against Vi Lyles in 2019 and in 2018 ran for this same role unsuccessfully (he finished 4th of 6 candidates at that time). He appears to be registered as a Republican in Mecklenburg County. 

**Duncan St Clair.** St. Clair last ran for a seat on the Board of Education. He appears to be the owner of a small batch coffee company. His LinkedIn profile has him as a park ranger and an insurance adjuster in his past. He appears to be registered as a Democrat in Mecklenburg County.

He has taken the online course “Climate Leadership Corps” which is an Al Gore initiative.  He advocates “a new dawn for Mecklenburg’s environment”—equitable, optimal and sustainable.

&#x200B;

**Voters are also being asked to vote on 3 referenda:**

· $100MM transportation bond

· $50MM housing bond

· $45MM neighborhood improvement bond

Jennifer Roberts, the former major of Charlotte, wrote an op-ed in the Observer on September 15 questioning the lack of details or information on the bonds. She actually demanded that the city give more detail. To see if the bonds may affect you, look at p21-25 of [this link](https://charlottenc.gov/budget/FY2021/adobted/FY2021_Adopted_Budget_Book-Final_Draft.pdf). There is some detail but not much. That said, the city budget for the coming year appears to be $2.5B.

How do you think the Charlotte public transit system should expand/improve (besides what they're already planning),"I obviously have no experience in urban or transit planning (though I hope to get an urban planning degree), and I highly doubt most of them would come through fruition (and *if* they do it would likely be radically different), but here is what I, personally, would like to see... eventually...

# Bus

[Trolleybus](https://preview.redd.it/c61lwjwjwjq51.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cd0e100cccfe7778a3b3fbf59fd93501e09d680)

I think that we should have most the local buses in Charlotte be [trolleybuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolleybus). They are more efficient than battery electric buses, since power is lost when charging batteries, especially when using fast charging. However, we could have it be a trolleybus/battery hybrid so that it can run off the poles during diversions, emergencies, or some outer local routes

# Light Rail

&#x200B;

[What a \\""Final\\"" map of our light rail system might look like](https://preview.redd.it/5fgkneptwjq51.png?width=2780&format=png&auto=webp&s=816ee34f49dcdddba55f16707812b131c29316e1)

Again, I am probably not the best person to plan light rail routes, especially when it comes to details and stuff like that (why do you think it takes *them* over a decade to even build those lines?), but I'm personally hoping to see something like this:

**Blue Line:** Past the Ballantyne extension they are thinking about, it should be extended to Stonecrest on Rea Rd to the south, and Downtown Harrisburg to the north

**Silver Line:** Basically what CATS is already planning, but extended to Belmont Abbey and McAdenville to the west

**Black Line:** Starts in Indian land near the intersection of US-521 and SC-160, goes north along US-521 to Ballantyne where it meets with the blue line and overlaps with it. Follows the Blue line until University city where the Blue Line splits off to UNCC and Harrisburg. The Black line continues along US-29/North Tryon until Charlotte Motor Speedway, then continues along Burton Smith to Concord Mills mall, and ends at Concord Regional Airport

**Red Line:** Starts at Weddington, goes north along NC-16, Splits off near Queens University and continues underground along East Boulevard until it meets the Blue/Black Lines, then turns north to meet the Silver Line and overlap it through much of Uptown. Then it goes on a path similar to the scrapped [red commuter rail line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-77_Bus_Rapid_Transit#Commuter_Rail) to downtown Huntersville

**Pink Line:** Starts near the intersection of Regent Parkway and US-21 in Fort Mill, and continutes to Downtown Pineville,Meets the Blue/Black Lines and overlaps with them until East/West Blvd, where it spits off and meets the Red Line. Overlaps the Red Line until WT Harris, where it splits off to go to Northlake Mall and then Northcrest shopping Center

**Purple Line:** Starts in Lake While, SC, and goes along SC/NC-49 until it diverts south and goes south of RiverGate Shopping center. Goes south of and along Choate and North of Carowinds until it meets Westinghouse, goes along it until it goes south of Arsley and then Reuinites with NC-49. Goes along NC-49 until I-77, where it unites with the Blue/Black/Pink lines. Overlaps with the Pink line to meet the Red Line, and Overlaps witht he red line until I-485, where it goes along it until it ends at Mallard Creek Community Park

**Green Line:** A ring line that goes somewhat parallel to [Charlotte Route 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Route_4) and I-85. Starting from underground Tyvola station (directly below the existing one on the blue line and connected via elevator) and going counterclockwise, it goes underground along Tyvola/Fairview until it has an underground station below SouthPark Mall. It then goes along Sharon Rd and then Wendover Rd to have a shared station with the Red Line. Continues along Wendover until it meets the Silver Line at Amity Gardens Station. Continues along Eastway and Sugar Creek until it meets the Blue/Black Lines at Sugar Creek Station, and has a shared station. And then continues along Sugar Creek until I-85, and has a shared station with the Red/Pink/Purple Lines. Continues along I-85 and shares the Rosa Parks CTC with the Gold Line Streetcar, it diverts north a bit when it meets NC-16, and then continues along I-85 for a bit more until it divers north a bit more. It meets the Silver Line among Strafford Station, and continues along Billy Graham until it meets the Purple Line, then goes back to Tyvola, which completes the loop

This commuter rail system (likely called LYNX Express or something) is designed to help people in Charlotte suburbs commute to Charlotte (although it also has some operation in the off hours and weekends) and Alleviate Traffic along the interstates. All lines start at Charlotte Gateway Station and go along 5 lines to Gastonia/Kings Mountain, Fort Mill/Rock Hill, Monroe/Wingate/Marshville, Concord/Kannapolis/Salisbury, and Huntersville/Mooresville/Statesville. Most of the railroads already exist except for the one connecting Mooresville to Statesville, but as we already know, the railroad companies aren't exactly willing to cooperate (Maybe we can take the tracks via eminent domain and charge a fee for the freight companies to use them, while giving Commuter Trains and Amtrak Priority)

Is there any place in Charlotte like California (meet new people/socialize/etc.)?,"So, this may sound like an odd question.  But, something that I noticed in California and out west was that you could go out and about in parks/beaches/shopping places/etc. and just go to places where there were large crowds of people.  You could randomly stop and meet new people by just talking to them and they were really open.  

Long of the short, I'm moving to Charlotte next week from out west and I really want to still be able to have that experience in Charlotte.  

Are there places where young people (or just people in general) tend to hang out?  I guess there is a college campus nearby, but I feel weird roaming around a college if I don't go there (although, I guess I shouldn't really care).

Also, a little background about me.  I'm 24 and graduated from a university out west.  I am going to be living with family in Charlotte probably for about a year (might eventually get an apartment).  I just really don't want to be bored and not do anything.  I want to be able to go out and meet new people, have some fun, etc..  Of course I will be eventually working, but I don't want to just work and go home.  

Any ideas?  I really don't want to have to go to bars/clubs to do this stuff.  Thanks for any help.  I am just scared I am moving to a city where I'm going to be extremely bored and have problems making new friends or meeting new people.",1346130468.0,throwaway50969,"Is there any place in Charlotte like California (meet new people/socialize/etc.)?

Also, a little background about me.  I'm 24 and graduated from a university out west.  I am going to be living with family in Charlotte probably for about a year (might eventually get an apartment).  I just really don't want to be bored and not do anything.  I want to be able to go out and meet new people, have some fun, etc..  Of course I will be eventually working, but I don't want to just work and go home.  

Any ideas?  I really don't want to have to go to bars/clubs to do this stuff.  Thanks for any help.  I am just scared I am moving to a city where I'm going to be extremely bored and have problems making new friends or meeting new people.",neutral,place charlotte like california meet new may sound like odd question something noticed california west could go go place large crowd people could randomly stop meet new people talking really open long short moving charlotte next week west really want still able experience charlotte place young people people general tend hang guess college campus nearby feel weird roaming around college go although guess really care also little background graduated university west going living family charlotte probably year might eventually get apartment really want bored anything want able go meet new people fun etc course eventually working want work go home idea really want go stuff thanks help scared moving city going extremely bored problem making new friend meeting new people

Church Recommendations,"Hi everyone! I 22 (f) am seeking Church recommendations in the Charlotte area, as I am new to the city.

I'm located near the university area, but I'm willing to commute.

I did go to Forest Hill this morning and I had a good experience. However, I wish that they allowed more time for worship and songs. Granted it was my first day here, so I would definitely be willing to go back.

Considering Charlotte for relocation,"My wife and I are considering relocating and Charlotte is currently one of the cities we are considering. We're getting rather fed up with Seattle and my wife quickly rejected my suggestion of looking at Texas and suggested Charlotte. 

A little background on us. We're both in our mid 20s, just had our first kid, I have an MBA from University of Washington and she has a Bachelors degree from there as well. I work in digital advertisement and make a fairly good living. She is a business analyst for an insurance company and makes ok money as well. While I say we live in Seattle we actually are about 25min north of the main city. Both of us have lived in WA since moving to the States (me 20+ years her 10+). We own a house and live pretty comfortably. Both of our parents live 10min North and South of us. I'm mostly Armenian and part Russian and she is 100% Russian. We've fully assimilated to US culture but still respect our background.

We're Libertarian. I am a huge advocate for the Second Amendment, respect the Constitution, hate Communism and am fine with the legalization of weed (I prefer alcohol but to each their own). While WA and Seattle used to be fairly balanced with Left and Right wing nut jobs, its becoming too far left for my liking. More and more legislation is passing that I don't agree with and there is constant threat of diminishing my passion (shooting). The massive influx of Californians is only making it worse. It's very quickly becoming a place I don't want to raise a family in. We do love the PNW outdoors. We love to go hiking and camping together. I spend most of my weekend mornings fishing or going out to a shooting pit.

My questions for Charlotte (or very close neighboring suburbs).

-How do you like it?

-What's the balance of political preference? I don't mind people of different opinion, I just don't like being the black sheep and having to constantly listen to my office berate my leanings.

-How is the job market in Charlotte? Particularly around advertising or tech product management.

-What's the NC firearm laws like? Concealed Carry? SBRs/Suppressors?

-That said, hows the firearm community? I am fairly active on a popular gun forum here and have met some great people through it.

-How are the public schools? 

-What areas around Charlotte are best avoided?

-How are the outdoor activities? Hiking, fishing, camping? I also hate snakes and know there are some venomous species around there. How often do you encounter them?

-What is there to do in or around Charlotte besides the outdoors?

-Anything else you think is necessary or want to tell me is greatly appreciated!

What Area in NC should our family move to?,"Hi folks! We're looking into NC--tell me the positives and negatives of Charlotte area vs. Raleigh area (or any other area in NC, in fact!). We have a 10-year-old into tech and engineering and my thoughts are to have her near enough to the UNC campus (or other major University) so that as she gets older, she can stay close to home when she goes to a good school. Looking for a suburb outside the major cities w/in 30 min drive.

I'm big on quality academic opportunities for her - public schools are fine, but not ruling out private/charter/magnet programs, so close proximity to the best schools is 80% of my decision making.

We prefer a larger lot/greenbelt/or about .5 acre lot with nice vegetation. Looking for new or fairly new homes that are move-in ready with a budget in the 500's. Ideally would like to build a pool (if one is not already on the lot).

We have never been to Charlotte, or NC for that matter, and would like residents' description of how it feels out there compared to other states/cities you may have lived in...the more details the better!

Our vibe for recreation is tennis, biking, hiking, movies, shopping, foodie finds - not clubs and bars!

Kindly help me out, I can't wait to get some feedback! Thanks!",1611794092.0,CedarPinesAus,"What Area in NC should our family move to? Hi folks!

We prefer a larger lot/greenbelt/or about .5 acre lot with nice vegetation. Looking for new or fairly new homes that are move-in ready with a budget in the 500's. Ideally would like to build a pool (if one is not already on the lot).

We have never been to Charlotte, or NC for that matter, and would like residents' description of how it feels out there compared to other states/cities you may have lived in...the more details the better!

Our vibe for recreation is tennis, biking, hiking, movies, shopping, foodie finds - not clubs and bars!

Kindly help me out, I can't wait to get some feedback!

"The owner of ""Farmer's BBQ"" in University City may be delusional","I follow the Wingzza truck on Twitter and the owner retweeted a tweet on June 28th from Farmer's BBQ that said that Yelp is a ""scam,"" apparently because it filters positve reviews of his restaurant but shows negative ones. I went to the Farmer's Twitter page and started reading through the tweets, which complains about customers, employees, and other businesses. The Twitter page is here: https://twitter.com/FarmersBBQ

I then went to the Yelp page which is here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/farmers-bbq-charlotte

It has a two star rating on Yelp so the reviews that showed up are mostly negative. There are 51 filtered reviews though, and there are a lot more positive filtered reviews than negative filtered reviews. I think that most of the reviews are filtered because the people that reviewed the resaurant haven't done many reviews. When I used Yelp, it filtered my reviews until I had written several. I think it is to make sure that people are real reviewers and not just writing one review to raise or lower the rating of a specific business. Regular Yelpers probably write more critical reviews than casual Yelpers which explains the negative ones not getting filtered.

The owner responded to people's reviews on Yelp including linking to a Youtube video of him checking the temperature of the food in response to a review that said the food was cold. The Youtube page for the restaurant is here: https://www.youtube.com/user/farmersbbq/videos

The Youtube videos are the worst part of this, because the owner put up videos of his employees stealing, slacking off, and not cleaning dishes and the restaurant correctly. That leads me to believe that these negative reviews are warranted and not an ""attack"" on the restaurant. 

This looks to me like a mild version of ""Amy's Baking Company"" from Kitchen Nightmares: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XjgHEctcy0

An open invitation to talk about gun control and learn more about the subject,"EDIT: To preface, if your intention is to post a comment purely about the debate on gun control where you are taking a solidified stance on one side or the other, I want to ask you to [read this first](https://medium.com/@kareems/the-path-forward-on-guns-fa92fcb93ab) before you say anything. It sums up mostly how I feel about the issue and what I want to promote among all of us as a whole.

Hey all! 

I've lived my whole life in Charlotte and love this city. Recently there has been much debate in the news and across the nation around the topic of guns and gun control.

Without taking a side in this post, I want to open an invitation to anyone on either side of the conversation who wants to talk about the issue (maturely, and without being emotionally charged) while also getting the experience to use or witness the use of a firearm in a controlled environment (indoor range). It is a free of charge offer, funded entirely by myself in a public setting (local indoor range). I only want to accept one or two people at most, and depending on how this goes I may do it more than once.

Remember! This is purely an educational offer. If you don't want an argument/debate around gun control, we don't have to have one and I will respect that. However, if conversation gets heated I will be calling it there and will not engage in further discussion. If we are on the range at that time I will be packing up and leaving because being emotionally charged around a firearm is irresponsible. I am offering this for the sole purpose of providing facts surrounding the ownership and use of firearms. 

If you are interested, please message me privately with what area in Charlotte you live in and a paragraph or two about why you are interested. I am only picking people who are interested in the facts **or** are willing to have an open and honest discussion about the topic. 

Ideally, those who can make the drive to Matthews, NC area would be preferred, but I won't leave anyone out who wants to meet elsewhere within a reasonable distance (mostly South Charlotte Area, University area, and Ballantyne, but I can make the stretch to just about anywhere where there is a reputable licensed indoor range).

The intent is about one hour in a controlled setting where you can either watch a firearm in use, actually use the firearm in said controlled setting, and talk about them during and/or before/after to gain a better working knowledge on what is being discussed in our society today. There is no intent on my side to change your mind about how you feel about guns and gun control, and I am okay with that being the case. If you walk away more certain about banning or enforcing further regulation on guns, then good for you. You are doing it with an educated opinion and that's all I can hope for.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing, and remember, we're all US citizens sharing the same great city, so please keep the responses civil and open minded!

EDIT: Hey guys, I'm just reading through the comments and I'm noticing a lot of debate that might get pretty heated. Please, let's keep this civil, and you want to debate it, please head to the appropriate sub. The conversation here should be limited as much as possible to talking about what we, here in Charlotte, are doing for our community.",1522092089.0,myachizero,"An open invitation to talk about gun control and learn more about the subject EDIT: To preface, if your intention is to post a comment purely about the debate on gun control where you are taking a solidified stance on one side or the other, I want to ask you to [read this first](https://medium.com/@kareems/the-path-forward-on-guns-fa92fcb93ab) before you say anything.

I was successfully appointed to the Bicycle Advisory Committee - here's what I'm doing first.,"Hey everyone! My name is John Holmes and I was appointed to the Bicycle Advisory Committee in a unanimous nomination by the City Council, for which I am thankful. That being said, I was serious about making sure that I hit the ground, not running, but sprinting, so here is what I have done and what I will be doing for the upcoming B.A.C. meeting on September 27th.


**Reached out to the City Council Transportation Committee.**

The City Councilmembers have been allocated towards varying committees, and Councilman Ed Driggs was appointed as the Chair of the Transportation Committee. I've butted heads with Councilman Driggs before, but he is very open to discussion and is a reasonable, level-headed person. He can be conservative and critical of CATS and some of the city's other initiatives, so I reached out to him immediately and got a response back today. Much to my surprise, Mr. Driggs is a road cyclist and was eager to hear about the frugal nature of my proposals for quick and fast bike lanes throughout the city, but he is getting adjusted and acclimated to this role as chair and wants me to reach back out to him next month.

**Community Outreach**

There are a few neighborhood associations that I've reached out to and will be having conversations with, either this week or next one. The first one is the Monroe Road Advocates, or MoRA, and we'll be meeting this Friday to discuss the upcoming plans for bicycle lanes in this part of Charlotte and what their thoughts and concerns might be.

In addition, I'll be meeting out to some of the leaders of local group rides in this city as I feel that their voices are valuable in these matters. I am also looking to perhaps having an outreach session virtually where people can drop in and out to give me their thoughts on certain items, let me know their concerns for cycling in the city, and so on.

**Introductions & Cooperation**

The day after I was appointed, I emailed all of the B.A.C. members and the relevant Charlotte DOT staff. Dustin Branham, the vice chair of the BAC, was quick to email me back and we will be having a meeting sometime next week. In addition, I also reached out to the head of the TSAC, which is the transportation-equivalent of the BAC, and we are comparing notes and trying to foster better cooperation between the two entities so that Charlotte can better provide more multi-modal options for its citizens.

**Collecting Community Concerns**

I'm keeping a running list of all the community concerns that are brought up to me and making sure that I bring them up to the B.A.C. and that they are addressed and that the answers are given back to the community. If you have any items, I want to hear them and I want to make sure that you get the answers you're looking for. Here are what I've got so far:

- Streaming the Bicycle Advisory Committee meetings for the public
- Coordinating with TSAC to better emphasize multimodality
- Talking to CDOT to figure out what we can do, what our obstacles are, and if we can advocate for the budget to be re-organized
- Addressing the lack of connectivity for pedestrians and cyclists to the VA Clinic in University
- CDOT, CATS, & Meck Co (P&R) Plans for connectivity to outdoor locations, such as Crowders Mountain, WWC, local parks?
- Are there any planned improvements for the Shannon Park & East Charlotte area to improve connectivity for cyclists?
- Is there anyway for a citizen to report a bike lane they believe is dangerous?
- Addressing the lack of bike parking at the Novant Health Midtown Medical Plaza.
- Frustrations with people parking in the bike lane without consequence. Does the city plan to address this in any way, and if so, how?
- Ebikes that are going too fast on greenways, sidewalks, and so on.

I always want to stress that I am here for you and the community at-large, and that we have the ear of the City Council. If there is anything that I can do to make sure you are heard, I want to do so. You can reach me at this profile and, if you would like, I am always more than happy to give you my personal contact information!",1663183456.0,ByzantineBaller,"I was successfully appointed to the Bicycle Advisory Committee - here's what I'm doing first.

CATS to End First Mile Last Mile Pilot Program,"Charlotte Area Transit System will culminate its First Mile Last Mile Pilot Program in partnership with Lyft on March 1, 2021.

"Bicycle Advisory Committee [Sept. 27, 2022] - Meeting Notes & Thoughts","**Introduction:**
You're either happy to see this post or extremely annoyed. Either way, hi! I'm John Holmes, recent appointee to the Bicycle Advisory Committee. Here are my notes and thoughts from the most recent meeting.

**Notes:**

* Had some interesting guests, such as Jerry(?) Lee, who is apparently a greenway advisor for Mecklenburg County. Jerry suggested that the city look into a greenway app to help local residents find greenways and recommended that we look at some examples that Raleigh, NC has set up.

* I was given the floor for three minutes to discuss the 28 items that I had collected from the public. I opted to speak primarily on the themes of people parking in bike lanes, hazardous roads that need to be improved, Vision Zero, and equitable distribution of lanes in a timely manner, streaming/recording the meeting, and shifting the budget from roadway expansion to roadway maintenance and investing in alternative modes of transportation to catch up.

* Angela Barry from Charlotte DOT gave a Vision Zero presentation, mentioning that they plan to lower the speeds of 10 miles of roads on the High Injury Network that have bike lanes on them. While I’m happy about this, myself and one of the other BAC members wanted to inquire further if this was just lowering the speed limit or if it included redesigning the road to encourage driving that actual speed. My chief concern as well is, what are we doing for the roads that *don't* have bike lanes?

* One item that popped up persistently when having back-and-forth about obstacles towards safer roadways was that Barry is supportive of safer streets but oftentimes encounters opposition from other agencies. At one point, Barry stated that she is “a fan of congestion and not widening the streets,"" highlighting that traffic congestion does work in reducing higher speed and overall fatalities as a result.

* When we asked what models they use to determine how low the speed should be for a certain area, Barry stated that they use the “Urban Model” which focuses on land-use context, US Limits which is a FHA model that examines crash history and pedestrian and bicycle activity, and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program’s model. Whichever one is the *lowest* becomes the set speed limit. My notes might be slightly inaccurate with the names, but I'll update them accordingly when the minutes are published.

* Someone stated that there is some interest in residential participation for Vision Zero, sort of like a neighborhood advocate. Another person asked [paraphrase], “Why can’t we have a Vision Zero lens that focuses on neighborhoods?” In a rare moment of me defending Charlotte DOT, I pointed out that we already seem to have that with the High-Injury-Network and that we shouldn’t necessarily add onto their workload.

* One item that the Bicycle Advisory Committee seems to want to engage with is the recent dismissal of traffic tickets as it seems to send the wrong message to motorists that they can drive recklessly with little consequence. I agree!

* I repeatedly asked Barry what we could do as the BAC & private citizens to help out with getting our streets redesigned to be safer and more accommodating to pedestrians, and she was not at liberty to dispel that information due to her professional code of conduct. While this might seem like a cop-out, it isn't and anyone with an MPA background can speak at length about why you shouldn't bad mouth or sell out your partners. Last thing you want is to permanently damage reputation with an org that you need to work with going forward. Barry did give me some examples of projects where there was back-and-forth after I continued to press and so I’ll investigate further. If anyone else wants to look into this, one of the projects apparently had something to do with North Tryon, specifically the part between 36th Street and Eastway.

* Tons of slots open on the BAC! 3 mayoral appointments available, 2 BOC Commission appointments, and 1 possible City Council vacancy coming up. If you are interested, APPLY!

* Talk of a joint meeting w/ TSAC, most likely on Nov. 10 (Semper Fi!). 

* The 28 point list of items I gathered from the community was added to the agenda so city staff will be answering them! Please be patient as I work on getting y’all these answers - BAC chair and vice chair are trying to brief me on the items that previous committee members have already reached answers for, questions that are outside the scope, and so forth. CDOT employees have an email of the list + physical copies in the meantime.

* Afterwards, meeting was adjourned. No parking needed to be validated because we all rode our bikes 😎

* We briefly discussed how long it would take for us to commute back - one person takes the Blue Line to the Arrowood Station (goddamn), two of us bike roughly 3-4 miles, and I (incorrectly) stated that I bike 12 miles to get home from Uptown (it's actually 10). When Angela Barry heard this, and remembered that I stated earlier that I had almost been hit while biking from UNCC to Uptown via N. Tryon, she asked me if I wanted a ride back up to University and I politely refused since I actually live all the way out in East CLT. Really sweet person.


**Closing Thoughts:**
I will say my combative attitude towards 
Charlotte DOT was somewhat softened, though I am curious who this competing agency is and if we are only lowering speed limits w/o redesign. My suspicions are that it is probably NCDOT that is being the boogeyman in the room, but I don't have that information just yet. 

As for the streaming item, city staff present did say it might be feasible but may be an issue of funding/staffing for it to occur. A possible workaround (and we'll need to check the code of conduct handbook for this) is that we could simply stream the meetings from our personal devices, so uh... I guess I could do that if its allowed.",1664344048.0,ByzantineBaller,"Bicycle Advisory Committee [Sept. 27, 2022] - Meeting Notes & Thoughts **Introduction:**

* The 28 point list of items I gathered from the community was added to the agenda so city staff will be answering them! Please be patient as I work on getting y’all these answers - BAC chair and vice chair are trying to brief me on the items that previous committee members have already reached answers for, questions that are outside the scope, and so forth. CDOT employees have an email of the list + physical copies in the meantime.

* Afterwards, meeting was adjourned. No parking needed to be validated because we all rode our bikes 😎

* We briefly discussed how long it would take for us to commute back - one person takes the Blue Line to the Arrowood Station (goddamn), two of us bike roughly 3-4 miles, and I (incorrectly) stated that I bike 12 miles to get home from Uptown (it's actually 10). When Angela Barry heard this, and remembered that I stated earlier that I had almost been hit while biking from UNCC to Uptown via N. Tryon, she asked me if I wanted a ride back up to University and I politely refused since I actually live all the way out in East CLT. Really sweet person.


**Closing Thoughts:**
I will say my combative attitude towards 
Charlotte DOT was somewhat softened, though I am curious who this competing agency is and if we are only lowering speed limits w/o redesign. My suspicions are that it is probably NCDOT that is being the boogeyman in the room, but I don't have that information just yet. 

As for the streaming item, city staff present did say it might be feasible but may be an issue of funding/staffing for it to occur. A possible workaround (and we'll need to check the code of conduct handbook for this) is that we could simply stream the meetings from our personal devices, so uh... I guess I could do that if its allowed.",neutral,bicycle advisory committee meeting note thought introduction either happy see post extremely annoyed either way hi john holmes recent appointee bicycle advisory committee note thought recent meeting note interesting guest jerry lee apparently greenway advisor mecklenburg county jerry suggested city look greenway app help local resident find greenway recommended look example raleigh nc set given floor three minute discus item collected public opted speak primarily theme people parking bike lane hazardous road need improved vision zero equitable distribution lane timely manner meeting shifting budget roadway expansion roadway maintenance investing alternative mode transportation catch angela barry charlotte dot gave vision zero presentation mentioning plan lower speed mile road high injury network bike lane happy one bac member wanted inquire lowering speed limit included redesigning road encourage driving actual speed chief concern well road bike lane one item popped persistently obstacle towards safer roadway barry supportive safer street oftentimes encounter opposition agency one point barry stated fan congestion widening street highlighting traffic congestion work reducing higher speed overall fatality result asked model use determine low speed certain area barry stated use urban model focus context u limit fha model examines crash history pedestrian bicycle activity national cooperative highway research program model whichever one lowest becomes set speed limit note might slightly inaccurate name update accordingly minute published someone stated interest residential participation vision zero sort like neighborhood advocate another person asked paraphrase vision zero lens focus neighborhood rare moment defending charlotte dot pointed already seem necessarily add onto workload one item bicycle advisory committee seems want engage recent dismissal traffic ticket seems send wrong message motorist drive recklessly little consequence agree repeatedly asked barry could bac private citizen help getting street redesigned safer accommodating pedestrian liberty dispel information due professional code conduct might seem like anyone mpa background speak length bad mouth sell partner last thing want permanently damage reputation org need work going forward barry give example project continued press investigate anyone else want look one project apparently something north tryon specifically part street eastway ton slot open bac mayoral appointment available boc commission appointment possible city council vacancy coming interested apply talk joint meeting tsac likely semper fi point list item gathered community added agenda city staff answering please patient work getting answer bac chair vice chair trying brief item previous committee member already reached answer question outside scope forth cdot employee email list physical copy meantime afterwards meeting adjourned parking needed validated rode bike briefly discussed long would take u commute back one person take blue line arrowood station goddamn two u bike roughly mile incorrectly stated bike mile get home uptown actually angela barry heard remembered stated earlier almost hit biking uncc uptown via tryon asked wanted ride back university politely refused since actually live way east clt really sweet person closing thought say combative attitude towards charlotte dot somewhat softened though curious competing agency lowering speed limit redesign suspicion probably ncdot boogeyman room information yet streaming item city staff present say might feasible may issue occur possible workaround need check code conduct handbook could simply stream meeting personal device uh guess could allowed
things we should stop tolerating as a city,"things i see that really, REALLY piss me off that i am shocked nobody brings up

1) walking in the street with a sidewalk RIGHT THERE

this one is fairly recent for me.  it doesn't matter if i'm in a subdivision, driving through a park, or going down a long road as a shortcut.  at least once a day i see somebody walking in the MIDDLE of my lane, sometimes even the middle of the WHOLE ROAD, when there's clearly a sidewalk nearby intended for this very purpose.

2) cyclists intentionally blocking traffic

this is the reason i've taken to itnentionally hitting cyclists in gta when i'm having a bad day.  cyclists riding in the exact center of the lane, holding up traffic by riding as slowly as they can, all with a smirk on their face because they know they're legally invincible and there's nothing anyone can do to stop them without going to prison.  i'm talking 10 mph in a 45 mph street with one lane per direction.  i make a point to call out their most ridiculous feature as i pass as a way of annoying them.

3) coming to a sudden, almost complete stop to make a right turn

we've all seen it.  we're driving down independence or wt harris when the car in front of us slams on their brakes and slows down to less than 5 mph just to make right turn.  not only is this WAY too common, but it's also DANGEROUS.  i can't tell you how many times i've had to burn a flat spot on all 4 tires because some old man decided ""imma turn now"" and slams the brakes to turn down a street at literally idle speed.  this is why i use my brakes no later than 15 seconds from my turn, gradually increasing brake strength. bonus points if they don't use their signal.  which brings me to my next point...

4) not using turn signals.

ah yes, the charlotte staple.  you've all heard the joke that cars in charlotte have turn signals as an optional feature.  i've even heard someone say that enforcing signals would ""rob charlotte of its identity"".  you have any idea how many times i've heard of people getting rear ended for not using their signal, or how often i've seen someone swerve off the road because someone almost sideswiped them with an unsignalled merge?  i tell you this, it's more than 100.  cops, PLEASE start enforcing the use of turn signals.  the last thing we need in this city is another 5 car pileup because old man hopkins decided to merge lanes into heavy traffic without signalling.

5) coming to a complete stop at the top of exit ramps

i've only seen this at the eastway exit from independence westbound, but i've seen it so many times.  old man hopkins decides he wants to go to showmars on eastway for dinner, but oh NO.  there's a car in his side mirror!  better come to a complete stop at the end of the ramp so that car (which isn't even on the overpass yet) can pass!  at least i know i'm not the only one who hates this, as one person got out of their car and yelled at old man hopkins to move his car or he would MAKE him move.  took him going back to his car and revving his engine to actually get him to let traffic (which was now backing up onto independence) flow again.

6) aggressive beggars

you mostly see them around monroe/wendover, all along sharon amity, and a few spots near university.  i'm talking about beggars that doj't hold signs, but will walk into the middle of the road to ask literally every single car to hear their 20 minute story.  the stories all sound the same, too.  ""my wife threw me out and took the kids and the dog and left me with nothing, can you please help me?""  I'm tempted to give these people $10 if it will make them stop WALKING INTO THE ROAD WHEN THE LIGHT IS TURNING GREEN.  at LEAST do it from the sidewalk!  also, if you're trying to scam people, don't wear a gucci jacket with brand new AF1s.

7) crossing the street at a slow pace

what are these people in, a slowmoguys video?  it really gets me when people do it in pitch black.  wearing all black clothing.  with their hood up.  around a blind curve.  while jaywalking.  this is so common that people are doing it on independence now.  whenever i see traffic stopped, my first thought has become ""somebody get hit again?""

8) not using crosswalks

this has been happening far too much in this city.  the worst offender?  wendover.  the city put in a crosswalk between the food lion and the apartments across from it, but i've only seen it being used ONCE.  i drive by that area multiple times a day and every time somebody is crossing the street, it's in the middle of the road.  hundreds of crossings witnessed, and i've only seen the crosswalk used one single time.

9) honking less than 2 seconds after the light turns green

oh, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to delay your trip by 10 seconds!  Seriously, why do people do that?  im not going to instantly go 45 mph the exact second the light changes.  my car can barely accelerate to 60 in less than 30 seconds unless i rev to 5k rpm in each gear.

10) high beams and offroad bars

by far, the biggest problem on this list in terms of leniency by law enforcement.  it does NOTHING for your vision unless it's pitch black, it does NOT need to be permanently on, and it's DANGEROUS because it blinds oncoming vehicles.  the biggest offenders of constant high beams seem to be anyone driving a 2006-2011 civic.  it's almost like those cars are DESIGNED to have permanent high beams because i have NEVER seen one of them at night WITHOUT high beams.

and then you have those damned LED offroad light bars.  WHY ARE WE ALLOWING THIS!?  these things are NOT intended for street use!  the boxes even say they shouldn't be used for such a purpose!  what's more, there are people who use them as a headlight replacement, drive past cops, and somehow DON'T get pulled over!  by far the worst offenders of this are people who mount them in the perfect spot to shine into smaller cars.  this can be on the grille of Chad Broski's lifted rolling coal F350 with those lego tires that goes BRRRRRRRRR on the highway, the fake hood scoop of a totally legitimate offroader wrangler rubicon with skulls on the tire cover in place of the E (aka JOOPs), or mounted on the roof and AIMED DOWNWARDS.  if it were up to me, these people would be A) arrested, 2) be subjected to staring at LED bars for an hour, and D) be forced to watch their precious bromobile get crushed right in front of them.  i have 0 tolerance for LED bars.  i've developed problems with brightness because of this trend, and i want to see justice served.",1611056808.0,onefinerug,"things we should stop tolerating as a city things i see that really, REALLY piss me off that i am shocked nobody brings up

How good would Charlotte be for a 22 Year Old?,"I am a soon to be college graduate that just got offered a job in Charlotte, NC. I'm going to be an entry-level Engineer.

"MidMarketOps CLT Philly Cheesesteak Ratings Revision #1 (including Portofino’s ratings, and other reflections)","I am grateful for the responses and insights to my thread from Monday [“Father's Day Fun – An analysis of 3 of the top Philly Cheesesteak establishments in town. Results within.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/s/a9NnIyBOJj)

The Cheesesteak gods were smiling on the MidMarketOps family and when the wife said she had a hankering for some Eggplant Parmesan (parmigiano?) I took it as an opportunity to add another entrant into the CLT Philly Cheesesteak analysis.  We rarely go out to eat on a weeknight.  Nevertheless, we jumped in the car and headed to Portofino’s on Park Road.

The Portofino’s and composite cheesesteak results are attached including some helpful revisions suggested by some of the thread commentors.  Of note:

·         Portofino’s service and ambience was excellent, however I found it the most disappointing cheesesteak of the lot.  The cheese wasn’t all the way melted (bread was warm), and the meat felt like it was under seasoned.  It was still reasonably satisfying to me but with a 3.25 taste score paled in comparison to the others.

·         The others we ordered take-out although Portofino’s we had dine-in.  I excluded tax and tip on the cost as was done on the other entries.  And Portofino’s Park Road patio makes for a lovely dining experience and our server was also a delight which explains the high Ambience and Service Excellence scores.  These factors are clearly less important in a take-out experience.

·         I kept the overall scores and also added a) “adjusted” scores excluding Kid 2 whose dissatisfaction of cheesesteaks was an outlier versus the other three respondents and b) “Dad Only Taste Scores” to really focus on taste from an enthusiast’s perspective (I have a 30-year history of cheesesteak appreciation including sampling of the “classics” in Philly (Jim’s, Pat’s Geno’s, Tony Luke’s, etc.).  Interestingly the Kid 2 adjusted scores did not appear to impact the real results, just the nominal  ratings.

·         I adjusted the overall statistics to analyze Mean instead of Median. Good call out on that.

·         My main takeaway is that “the best” of something like food or dining experience is incredibly subjective person to person.  For example with this sample size of 4:

          o   “Overall” winner is Portofino’s with a 4.00 (vs. 3.66, 3.63, and 3.56).  And adjusting for Kid 2 generally held this result.

          o   “Value for money” winner is House of Pizza, again Kid 2 adjustments maintain that result.

          o   However just me (e.g. “cheesesteak enthusiast”) and focused only on taste Portofino’s is dead last with Cheat’s as the winner.

          o   Consequently, I try to generally enjoy any experience without seeking absolute perfection.  If the food and the experience were reasonably enjoyable, that is already a “life win” in my book.  With that said I will not be going out of my way to get a Portofino’s cheesesteak anytime soon.

·         Based on the responses I am most looking forward to scoring next: Duckworth’s (I have had it on occasion and generally enjoyed it), Steak n’ hoagie (never been on my radar), Pasta and Provisions (never been on my radar for cheesesteaks), and Yancey @4001 (never been on my radar for cheesesteaks).  Some of the others mentioned (e.g., Queen City Cheesesteaks, Lee’s Hoagie House/Shack, and Jack Beagle’s I’ll keep an eye out for)

·         Some of the comments cracked me up.  In particular:

           o   “Mayonnaise on a cheesesteak is diabolical.”

           o   “Someone just got their MBA at Grand Canyon University”

           o   “List is crap” (I respect the effort required to post this concurrent with the lack of effort on elaborating the shortcomings. I found it amusing in a fun way.)

Johnson Volvo sucks majorly,I am a die hard Volvo lover. I'm on my 3rd one and even converted my husband to be a Volvo lover. Our current ones are from Volvo of Charlotte. Never had any issues with the dealership until I discovered they had been bought by Johnson Cars when I needed service in September. My car was flooding every time it rained. I called the end of August and they said they could get me in in October. I told them my car was literally flooding every time it rained and I was worried about the interior becoming damaged. They fit me in mid September. I dropped my car off for my scheduled appointment and ubered home (they no longer offer loaners). Then I heard fuck all from them for 2 days. Calling didn't produce any results. Getting pissy finally got someone to call me back. Apparently they only have 1 water tech and he had to go to training the day my appointment was scheduled. Why they didn't communicate this I don't know. They told me I should be thankful because they had 4 whole techs when everyone else has 2. They finally cleanied my clogged sunroof and told me my motor had died. I have an extended warranty so I told them I wanted it repaired. They said they would order the part and call me. I never heard from them. When I finally called to track it down they said their part warehouse was in FL and had just been hit by a hurricane. I still haven't heard anything regarding my part. I was in a small fender bender last week and was looking to find a body shop to get an estimate from and the one I used previously doesn't appear to still be in business. I called the Volvo dealership to get a body shop recommendation. I asked for a recommendation and they said they didn't have one. I find this hard to believe. There's no shop in the entire city of Charlotte that they direct their customers to? They told me I needed to call my local dealership. I told them they were my local dealership. I asked if there was a service advisor available I could speak with and was told no. I told my husband we needed to find a new brand of vehicles because I'm not buying another thing from this shitty dealership. My husband told me to call University Volvo. I called them and they are not owned by Johnson Cars so crisis averted on needing a new brand of vehicle. I was considering switching to Subaru. Anyone have any body shop recommendations.,1673386577.0,bumble-bee-22,Johnson Volvo sucks majorly I am a die hard Volvo lover. I'm on my 3rd one and even converted my husband to be a Volvo lover.

## Board of Commissioners At Large (vote for 3)

**Patricia (Pat) Cotham.** Cotham is an incumbent on the board and has been a fixture in Mecklenburg County politics for years. She has served 5 terms on the board.  She seemed to express frustration with CMS in an Observer interview when she said that “CMS has not communicated well and they restrict interaction with us.” She says she has a good relationship with State Senator (now US Congressional candidate) Jeff Jackson and calls herself a “broad-based Democrat” (as opposed to someone focused on a single-issue). 

Cotham responded to me soon after I sent her a note through the form field on her website, which was hard to find as her website address is only listed on her Facebook page and leads to a dead link.  When I did manage to reach her, her responses were direct.  I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness (in spite of a difficult-to-find website) because she responded very quickly. Her responses were terse and direct. (Incumbent, Age 72, White, Democrat)

**Arthur Griffin Jr**. Griffin is a long time civil servant having been previously been the chair of the CMS Board of Education (from 1997 to 2002). He is a retired executive from publishing house McGraw-Hill Education.  He believes that absenteeism is a key problem for low-performing CMS schools and proposes quarterly meetings between CMS and other city officials to decrease the achievement gap.

Griffin reached out to me personally responding to my email and in a phone call, he asked that if he did get elected, if I could help address some of the issues I asked about in my outreach to him.  I found that to be a rare yet gracious way to engage with his community. He acknowledged that this would be a tough election. He mentioned that his dream for Charlotte would be a “10 minute” neighborhood where all residents had key services available within walking distance.  He says he wants to incentivize more construction of vital services like health care near more diverse neighborhoods. He also said that he is not inclined to raise taxes given the increases in property values, but that the county is entrusted with funding many critical services including schools, courts and parks.  I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 74, Black, Democrat). 

**Tatyana Thulien**. Thulien is a Ukranian immigrant who moved to the US in 1998 and Charlotte in 2011.   She has been a singer, journalist and teacher in her time in the US. She says that county residents need to have a “genuine voice for their needs and issues.” She mentioned fair property taxes and public health as two key issues of importance to her.  She mentioned being dismayed at the amount of money spent on CMS but without strong results to show for it. She also mentioned that she wants “our faith not to be humiliated and abandoned.” As she grew up in the former Soviet Union, she says that “socialism is not making everyone equal.” She is the mother of two.

I reached out to her a few times and had challenges getting in touch with her.  The email from the Board of Elections site bounced back.  When I submitted a question in the form field, I did receive a note back asking if she could email me responses but I never heard anything subsequent to that.  I gave her a C-/D+ for accessibility and responsiveness as a result.  (White, Republican)

**Leigh Altman**. Altman is a public interest attorney and an incumbent on the board. She was also an Assistant Attorney General in the state of Georgia many years ago. Altman’s key issues include innovative job initiatives, a strong mental health system, equity in public schools, expanded mass transit options, better funded parks and greenways, LGBTQ rights, a science-based response to the pandemic and transparency in government. She also mentions reducing gun violence. She has talked about women’s reproductive rights issue as well on her website during the primary, but that content appears to have been removed.

Altman wrote me back in short but direct sentences soon after I pinged her on her website form field.  I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Approx age 50s, White, Democrat)

### Board of Commissioners District 1

**Ross Monks.**  Monks is a retired executive from Ingersoll Rand.  In his retirement, he attended local government meetings and was quickly dismayed by what he saw as a lack of business acumen, particularly measurement and accountability.  He was surprised to hear that CMS didn’t do exit interviews with the 1000 teachers who departed during the pandemic, which he thought was important in understanding systemic causes of the departures.  He says “every business, school and place of worship is essential” on his website though in my conversation with him, he was primarily focused on schools, literacy rates and law enforcement. 

Monks invited me to have a call with him when I emailed him.  He spent 40 minutes on the phone with me talking about his background and his reasons for running (this is his first campaign.)  He is running because he believes that he is a “common sense servant leader who can bring best practices” to local government.  He believes the most important issues in the county are to fix schools and to get more students up to a grade-level reading standard, to fix the Sheriff’s department which is understaffed, and to manage the county tax level given that there has been “a 48% increase in residential property valuations.”  He says he was an independent until he decided to run, and then decided to run as Republican because it was impossible to have a serious candidacy as an unaffiliated candidate.  He doesn’t believe that this position in particular is ideological in nature.  He said that he likes his opponent as a person but that she is lacking a business background and is much more focused on environmental issues, which Monks believes are “secondary to education.” I found him very approachable and pragmatic and gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 60, White, Republican)

**Elaine Powell.**  Powell is currently an incumbent on the board. She is currently serving her second term. She says she is a “champion of environmental stewardship” and that she has been a volunteer and active in the community for over 30 years.  She says on her website she can’t stand bullies and that she’s inclusive.  She is a native of Delaware and moved to Charlotte in the late 1980s.

I did not hear back from her and gave her an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Incumbent, Age 59, White, Democrat)

### Board of Commissioners District 2

**Vilma Leake.**  I didn’t reach out to her as she is uncontested and appears to be an unshakeable institution in her district.  I have heard Charlotte residents describe her as “mean” and “vindictive” but she also appears to be fiercely loyal to her constituents.  She was recently in the news for allegedly trying to communicate with a judge about a juvenile case of one of her constituents. She denied the allegations.  (Incumbent, Black, Democrat)

### Board of Commissioners District 3

**George Dunlap**. Dunlap is an incumbent who has served 8 terms on the board and is currently the chairman of the board. Prior to his time as commissioner, he served 14 years on the CMS Board.  He was born in Pineville and graduated from South Mecklenburg High School. He is a former CMPD officer. The top issues listed on his website are economic development, education and affordable housing. He believes in investing in Business Investment Grants to bring jobs into the community, and that CMS should provide a “high quality education for all of our children.”

I emailed him and he directed me to resources that he said had interviews that answered my questions but I couldn’t find very much information on those websites, and none that directly answered my questions.  His website also had no contact information either so I gave him a C+/B- for accessibility and responsiveness. Many of his responses were non-specific and bland.  (Age 66, Black, Democrat)

**Dianna Benson.** Benson is active in the Mecklenburg County Black Republican Club. She does not appear to have a campaign website.  She said in an Observer interview that one of her accomplishments that she is most proud of is graduating college.  She wrote me back within 48 hours of my initial email to her.  She said that she in in favor of low property taxes and that it is worth the County Commission exploring “holding the purse strings” from CMS as a way to ensure that Commission has “a say in what our children are learning.”  She also said that “our parks and recreation should be funded and improved to make our parks more enjoyable for both children as well as adults.” Because she had no easily available contact information and she was curt but direct in her responses, I gave her a C+/B- for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 63, Black, Republican)

### Board of Commissioners District 4

**Ray Fuentes.**  Fuentes moved to Charlotte 35 years ago and was a former employee of Charlotte Water and Coca-Cola.  The key issues cited on his website are community safety and safety in schools, a clean environment, and lower property taxes. He served for 9 years on the Mecklenburg County Air Quality Commission.

When I emailed him, he promptly and politely wrote me back to say that he would follow up.  I didn’t hear back from him so gave him a C-.  (Age 58, Hispanic, Republican)

**Mark Jerrell.**  Jerrell is an incumbent on the board. His bio says that he is “committed to building bridges and breaking down barriers and ensuring that resources are accessible for our most vulnerable residents.”  His key issues are affordable housing, college and career readiness, and economic mobility.  Though he has been on the board for two terms, I didn’t find much more about his positions or projects.  He is a father of two young girls.   

Jerrell also quickly wrote me back and said he would respond with more details but I didn’t hear back.  He listed an additional way to contact him on his website so I gave him a B- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 52, Black, Democrat)

### Board of Commissioners District 5

**Laura Meier.**  Meier is currently serving on the board representing District 5 since 2020. She lists “equitable schools,” “housing” and “parks and recreation” on her website as her areas of advocacy.  She also mentions mental health and safe neighborhoods.  She is a former teacher of at-risk youths and a graduate of App State University. She was a leader of the Charlotte Women’s March.

She responded to me quickly but seemed skeptical of why I was gathering this information. She responded to me with 3 sentences a few days later.  I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness because she provided multiple ways to contact her and she responded quickly but the content of her responses seemed shallow. (Incumbent, Age 53, White, Democrat)

**Matthew Ridenhour.**  Ridenhour is a former county commissioner (2012-18) and has run for a number of different public offices since then.  He is generally well-regarded as a strong public servant in Mecklenburg County.  His website showcases beautiful parks, safe streets and great schools. In an Observer interview, he mentions food deserts and “whether a child has a full stomach” as issues that local government should address.  Regarding taxes, he wants a “fair, equitable and transparent revaluation next year.”  He also cited defeating the MLS/Memorial Stadium deal which he said would cost taxpayers $100MM.  He is the father of two elementary school age children.

Ridenhour wrote me back very quickly and was polite in his tone and responses. I asked him about the single-family zoning changes in Charlotte and he responded that “I lean toward being in favor of removing the single-family zoning, though I would say I only very lightly and cautiously support it.”  I also asked him about public charging stations for electric vehicles and he said he wasn’t in favor of using county dollars for it because “those who own electric vehicles—a demographic that tends to be upper middle class or wealthy.”  He did however support public electric vehicles for transportation. I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness.(Age 45, White, Republican)

### Board of Commissioners District 6

**Susan Rodriguez-McDowell.**  She was one of the only commissioners who disagreed with the board about holding back CMS money back in 2021. At the time, that action was viewed as a stunt by many local parents who felt that students would be the biggest losers in that standoff. She did respond to me after a few days but was thoughtful in her response.  I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness.

**Jeremy Brasch.**  Brasch says he is running to provide choice.  There was very little information about him and I didn’t even see a website. He has unsuccessfully run for the board twice before.  He did however respond immediately to my email and was most vocal when talking about the single family housing zoning changes that were in the news recently (homeowners can now build multifamily units in single family neighborhoods; this is an attempt to relieve housing shortages.)  I gave him a B for accessibility and responsiveness, mainly because he appears to have no website. 

## Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education

This is a non-partisan election though I did cite party affiliation where I found it.  CMS has been plagued by a number of issues ranging from low student performance to teacher retention problems to gun incidents and assaults on teachers, as well as missteps in funding allocation, as well as turnover in its superintendent.  Nearly everyone who responded to me said that the current Board has failed in its duties, including incumbents currently on the Board. 

### Board of Education District 1

District 1 has the greatest number of candidates.  It represents the northern-most part of the county.

**Rhonda Cheek.**  Cheek has been an incumbent on the board for 13 years.  She initially said  she wasn’t going to run again but then changed her mind recently.  She says on her website that her key priorities are “setting high expectations,” “improving school safety” (including body scanners),  “allocating resources efficiently” and “protecting neighborhood schools.”  She is also a registered nurse and real estate broker.  She is an advocate of increasing magnet programs to give families choice. Creek is a registered Republican.

Cheek wrote me back relatively quickly.  She was very terse in her responses.  She did mention that the average tenure for superintendents nationally is 5 years and that it would be worth exploring a retention bonus at the 5 year mark.  I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, White, Republican)

**Melissa Easley.**  Easley is a former teacher and parent of two CMS students.  She says her goals are to “repair relationships with our teachers, staff and community,” to support the “lowest performing schools” and focus on “high academic achievement.” 

Easley listed a few different ways to contact her on her website and responded to me after my 2nd email.  She was polite and apologetic in her response back to me and her responses were non-inflammatory and diplomatic.  She said that regarding superintendent turnover, “consistency is something that is needed in CMS” and that she preferred to stay focused on the future.  Regarding parental involvement, she said that the board needs to “get a good sense of a variety of different groups and connections.” I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 39, White, Democrat)

**Hamani Fisher.** Fisher is a pastor who appears to have 3 children (based on a photo on his website), and said he is running because he is “concerned about the future of Mecklenburg County’s children, families and overall well-being.” Fisher has “accountability, transparency and restored trust” as the key issues listed on his website. In interviews, he has said that collaboration between parents and schools is the solution to safety issues as well as student performance.  With respect to specific initiatives, there are very few listed on his website and I did not hear back from him in spite of reaching out twice.  I gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 46, Black, Democrat)

**Bill Fountain.**  Fountain is a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, former high school math teacher and amateur author. He believes it is critical to “enforce student discipline for productive classrooms” and wants to “hold the superintendent accountable for student performance.”  He believes “God made us male and female” and that sexuality is not a “pathological choice.”  On his website he also made remarks saying that he found it offensive to assign pornographic books for students to read, that dictating mask-wearing was wrong and that schools taught false notions about “our shared history.”

Fountain held back nothing in his email back to me where he passionately communicated why he is running and what his grievances are with the current board.  He said he is “the only one candidate challenging the woke culture in CMS.” He said that Cornelius Elementary and North Meck HS both needed attention in addition to the schools in the south part of the county.  He said “the eight women on the board failed in hiring Ernest Winston” and that “this woke cancer involves blaming white people for black and brown students low test scores, thus robbing the black and brown children of their self-worth.” He wrote me back within two days of my reaching out, which was faster than any of the other candidates from District 1 that I emailed.   I gave him an B- for his accessibility and responsiveness mainly because his responses, while candid, were disparaging toward minorities and the women on the CMS board. (Age 79, White, Unaffiliated)

**Ro Lawsin.**  Lawsin is a first-generation Filipino-American who said he is running to increase safety and security in schools. He has 3 children who are or were in CMS and said that “new leadership is desperately needed” in District 1. He believes the north part of the county should have been better represented in the last bond referendum. He received negative media attention when he was dismissed as the tennis coach at Hough High School for an altercation with a student. In an Observer interview, he said his father committed suicide in 2019 and he is living out his father’s dream.  He did not respond to me after I reached out twice.  I gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 53, Asian, Republican)

### Board of Education District 2

This is the west central part of Charlotte (around Steele Creek).

**Juanrique Hall**.  Hall does not appear to have a website but according to the Observer, he has a “lengthy criminal history.” His past record includes fleeing and eluding arrest, disorderly conduct and reckless driving, among dozens of other offenses. He claims he was a CMS football coach but CMS said he was never on the district payroll.  He believes his life experience is crucial to helping others. He says he is the only candidate serving students “not sides.” I did not find contact information for him until late in the process so did not reach out to him in time for this writeup. (Age 50, Black, Democrat)         

**Monty Witherspoon.**  Witherspoon ran for an at-large seat on the school board in 2019.  He is a pastor at Steele Creek AME Zion Church and was a substitute teacher in NYC. He lists student achievement, a safe learning environment, support for teachers, strong community coalitions and system-wide accountability and transparency on his site as his key issues.  When he last ran for school board (an at-large seat in 2019, he placed 5th in that election), he advocated for more AP classes.  He appears to have two young children.  He has a doctorate degree and graduated from Olympic High School. (Age 43, Black, Democrat)

I gave him a solid B.  He responded after my 2nd email to him and sent me back high level but not very specific responses.  He said that the high turnover of CMS superintendents was due to “faulty leadership by the Board” and that regarding parent involvement, “academic success and well-being of all students should be the focus.”

**Thelma Byers-Bailey.** Byers-Bailey did not have a website but she is an incumbent on the school board (the vice-chair in fact) who has served since 2013. She is an attorney and a graduate of West Charlotte High School.  She is a grandmother. She said she fought to keep the IB magnet programs at Harding and West Charlotte High Schools when others wanted to eliminate them.

I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness.  Her only contact information was on the CMS website, but she did write back a thoughtful response, particularly on some of the notorious missteps of CMS, including the hiring of superintendents and[ the see-through backpack fiasco](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/education/cms-clear-backpacks-bid-auction-sale/275-fd8549d0-5b4d-4537-88c4-f23257b0cd61).  (Age 79, Black, Democrat) 

### Board of Education District 3

This is the north west part of Charlotte, south of District 1.

**Greg “Dee” Rankin.**  Rankin is a Charlotte native who says that the CMS Board “needs a candidate that is not focused on politics…but on improving student outcomes.”  He was a former educator in CMS and mentor for youth.  He says that when he attended CMS, “it was known around the country as a model district.”  But as it became more segregated racially and socio-economically, that has changed. He lists education, equity and experience on his website as his campaign philosophy.  He is the father of 3. I did not hear back from him and gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 47, Black, Democrat)

**Steven Rushing.**  Rushing describes himself as the owner of a kid taxi company and a “regular, everyday father.”  He listed jury duty as his previous civic involvement. In an Observer interview, he said his idea for improving safety was a “dads on duty” program and said that removing cell phones from classrooms would improve the achievement gap. He does not appear to have a website and he did not respond to my email. I gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 48, “Half Latin American,” Democrat)

### Board of Education District 4

This is the south western part of Charlotte, including East Meck High School and the town of Mint Hill.

**Carol Sawyer.**  Sawyer is an incumbent on the board and was first elected in 2017. She is a former CMS parent, former CMS employee and currently a volunteer. She says that the NC General Assembly should raise educator pay.  In an Observer interview, she said that regarding school safety, “I support the continued expansion of restorative practices rather than exclusionary discipline for all but the most serious infractions in our schools.”  She also mentioned in the interview that she believes in strong leaders who support equity and anti-racism. I did not hear back from Sawyer and gave her an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Incumbent, Age 64, White).

**Stephanie Sneed.**  Sneed is an attorney and CMS parent. Sneed ran for an at-large seat in 2019 when she placed 4th.  She also unsuccessfully ran against Carol Sawyer in 2017.  She says in an Observer interview that one of the reasons she is running is that “District 4 has now become the lowest performing, with 65% of schools deemed as low performing. It is time for new leadership that will have a laser focus on student outcomes and ending educational gaps.” She is endorsed by the Black Political Caucus of Mecklenburg County and Congresswoman Alma Adams as well as 3 county commissioners (Pat Cotham, Leigh Altman and Mark Jerrell). I reached out to Sneed but did not hear back from her; I gave her an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 47, Black, Democrat)

**Clara Witherspoon.**  Witherspoon is a former school counselor and CMS employee. The issues she cites on her website are “effective leadership” and “supporting success for all students.”  There appeared to be little information about her online.  Witherspoon (no relation to Monty Witherspoon who is running for Commissioner) wrote me back with very high level responses to my questions that made me question if she understood the responsibilities of the board.  I asked her about her thoughts on zoning for the new South Charlotte high school and she responded, “My campaign focus is equity and equality for all students regardless of the school.”  That said, she did write me back.  I gave her a B for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 65, Black, Democrat)

### Board of Education District 5

This includes Matthews and much of South Charlotte.

**Lisa Cline.**  Cline is retired now but was a longtime CMS employee (teacher and assistant principal) who is campaigning on the slogan of “reclaiming education.”  Her website has her issues being tackling learning loss, ensuring that graduates are career ready, and creating good communication between parents and schools. While this election is non partisan, Cline is a registered Republican.  She said she was involved in the “fight to save Old Providence Park when CMS wanted to build a high school there.”

I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness.  I wrote her on a Saturday and I received her response back by Monday morning. She offered to also do an in-person meet and greet with me and any other parents I knew if I wanted. She said that her opponent “is supported by a number of public officials, mainly Democrats” and that “I was one of the people who worked long hours with teachers and students to raise the scores” when CMS won the Broad Prize. She says she is the best candidate because she is someone “ who has worked on the East, South, and West sides of Charlotte and was a parent at the same time.” For the full text of her responses, see my spreadsheet and search “Cline.”  (Age 62, White, Republican)

**Trent Merchant.**  Merchant is a former teacher and theater department director. He is a Charlotte native and his 3 children are or were CMS students.  He was a former CMS board member several years ago and says that as “an experienced executive search consultant” he is well-positioned to help the search for the next CMS superintendent. On his website he says that when schools that talk about Jim Crow laws, race-based slavery and secession by the Confederate states, that “is not CRT (critical race theory).”  His website had much more comprehensive information that suggested solid insight into current CMS issues.  He is currently registered as an unaffiliated voter and is endorsed by a number of current and former city and county elected officials. 

I gave Merchant an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness.  He had multiple ways to contact him on his website and wrote me back without a few hours of my emailing him.  He directly answered my questions and had some creative thoughts about the school assignments for the new South Charlotte high school which will probably affect District 5 and 6 the most.  See the spreadsheet (link at top) for the full text of his responses.  (Age 52, White, Unaffiliated)

### Board of Education District 6

I actually think this is the most competitive district because there is a long-standing incumbent who is broadly respected within the community and his two challenges appear to also be bright, capable, caring individuals.  This district includes Ballantyne and Pineville and stretches across the entire southern part of the county.

**Summer Nunn.**  Nunn is a mother of 2 CMS children in elementary school and a marketing executive who has worked at a number of regional companies including Red Ventures.  She indicates that the board should have parents with children in elementary school which is “45% of our students who are facing very different challenges than they did 5 to 10 years ago.”  She serves on her school’s Parent Teacher Leadership team.  She said she has navigated Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and 504s.  She is one of the few candidates who bought paid search ads on Google (likely a byproduct of her professional marketing background.)

When I reached out to her late one evening, she emailed me back the following morning and seemed to be very committed to gathering feedback from the community, particularly on issues like zoning for the new high school in South Charlotte. She said she is “not in favor of censoring materials or teachers' ability to adapt the curriculum to best reach our students just because a parent or a few of them are complaining.” She agrees that CMS has “a leadership problem.”  She said that she’s heard from teachers that the leadership changes with the superintendent mean that priorities change which inhibits an idea “to get off the ground or work.” I gave her an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 39, White, Democrat)

**Sean Strain.**  Strain is an incumbent on the board and has served since 2017.  He lists his priorities as “high expectations and accountability,” “great leaders” and “equity.”  He is the father of 4 CMS students. He wants a strong network of neighborhood schools “supplemented by a robust menu of magnet and choice schools.”

Strain was perhaps the most responsive candidate of everyone that I connected with.  I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness.  He is clearly passionate about CMS and has a very strong perspective on where mistakes were made in the past. He believes that he has a reputation as the “voice of reason” and is “not clouded by the various other social issues and agendas that come knocking on a weekly basis.” He said that the Board and the CMS Superintendent need to “stop being politicians” and making political decisions “popular with some of their constituents  (e.g., the radical use of age-inappropriate materials in the classroom, lowering standards and expectations for teachers and students)” which was causing the noise. (Age 50, White, Republican)

**Michael Watson.**  Watson is the father of 2 CMS high school students. He is an IT professional and a small business owner. The key issues listed on his website are “school safety,” “administrator and teacher retention and recruitment,” “collaboration” and “transparency and communication.” He said that he was originally part of the community discussion around the Rea Farms STEAM program which had concerns from Polo Ridge parents, but ultimately “Rea Farms has proven to be a great school.”

Watson also wrote me back quickly and described himself as a highly involved parent who has served on the parent-teacher groups at a number of schools in his district. Regarding superintendent turnover, he said, “the Board has failed in one of its more critical duties and that is to find and select competent effective leadership for our district.”  He acknowledged that the race would be a tough one.  He has fewer ways to contact him on his website than the other candidates though his responses to me were thoughtful and well-written. He believes that one of the reasons for overcrowding in District 6 is that “we aren’t enforcing residency rules strictly enough.” I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 41, Black, Democrat)

&#x200B;

## Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor

This is the second non-partisan race though I cited party affiliation where it was publicly available. Citizens can cast their vote for 2 candidates every 4 years. Carter and Bleiweis are incumbents and are both incredibly passionate about the environment.  I gave them each an A for accessibility and responsiveness.  No summary could do them justice as they both had extensive responses to my questions; Carter wrote nearly a whole page about her background, her experience in conservation and her accomplishments. 

As for the other candidates, one is a convicted felon who has run unsuccessfully for this role before.  The other two have little to no information online about their candidacies, which should be enough to dismiss them as serious contenders.  There is an opportunity for two write-ins as well.         

**Nancy Carter**.  She is currently the vice-chair of the board and has been on it since January 2012.  Prior to her 10 years on this board, she was on the Charlotte City Council for 12 years. She said she stepped down from the City Council (which she loved) because “of 11:40pm calls” and the fact that it was a part-time job but demanded 60-80 hours a week.  She is running again for this board because “I love what I do in this position.” She grew up loving forests and clear, running water. She said she lobbied hard and got money recently from the NC General Assembly for removal of debris from streams, a proactive measure to reduce flooding.  (Late 70s, Incumbent, White)

**Alonzo Hill.**  There was little information available about Hill but he does appear to be on the steering committee of a local non-profit. He appears to be the founder of a holistic product company selling skincare products  It is unclear if this is the[ same candidate](https://www.ucityfamilyzone.com/team/hill%2C-alonzo-), so if anyone knows, please confirm.  (Est Age 56, Black, Democrat)

**Tigress Sydney Acute McDaniel.**  McDaniel is a perennial candidate who has consistently run for something since I first created these writeups several years ago.  She has never won, nor come close.  She was convicted of identity theft in her past and has shared long-winded explanations of the circumstances leading to her conviction online.  This is at least the second time I have known her to run for this position.  She has no clear background in or passion for the environment as far as I could tell and is not a candidate who should be taken seriously.

**Hunter Wilson**.  There is little available about this candidate.  There are two possibilities I think: one listing for a Hunter Wilson on social media is a rafting instructor at the US Whitewater Center. This is the other: https://lakewylie.guru/about/ Can someone confirm if any of these people are the candidates? 

**Barbara Bleiweis.** Bleiweis is the current Chair of the board of supervisors and says she is running again “because there is still so much to do!” She is involved in a Farmland Preservation Plan as well as outreach programs such as soil education for the community, and Charlotte’s Tree Canopy Action Plan.   She is currently in her first term. (Incumbent, Age 65, Democrat) 

## Bond Referenda

There are three bond referenda that Charlotte city residents will have the opportunity to approve or reject.  According to the Charlotte city government’s website, Charlotte has an AAA credit rating.  The first proposal is for **City of Charlotte Transportation Bonds in the amount of $146MM.**  The second is **City of Charlotte Housing Bonds in the amount of $50MM** for low income housing.  The third is **City of Charlotte Neighborhood Improvement Bonds in the amount of $30MM.**  The city has requested bonds in the amount of $1B before (for schools) so this seems modest in comparison.

## Board of Commissioners At Large (vote for 3)

**Patricia (Pat) Cotham.** Cotham is an incumbent on the board and has been a fixture in Mecklenburg County politics for years. She has served 5 terms on the board.  She seemed to express frustration with CMS in an Observer interview when she said that “CMS has not communicated well and they restrict interaction with us.” She says she has a good relationship with State Senator (now US Congressional candidate) Jeff Jackson and calls herself a “broad-based Democrat” (as opposed to someone focused on a single-issue). 

Cotham responded to me soon after I sent her a note through the form field on her website, which was hard to find as her website address is only listed on her Facebook page and leads to a dead link.  When I did manage to reach her, her responses were direct.  I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness (in spite of a difficult-to-find website) because she responded very quickly. Her responses were terse and direct. (Incumbent, Age 72, White, Democrat)

**Arthur Griffin Jr**. Griffin is a long time civil servant having been previously been the chair of the CMS Board of Education (from 1997 to 2002). He is a retired executive from publishing house McGraw-Hill Education.  He believes that absenteeism is a key problem for low-performing CMS schools and proposes quarterly meetings between CMS and other city officials to decrease the achievement gap.

Griffin reached out to me personally responding to my email and in a phone call, he asked that if he did get elected, if I could help address some of the issues I asked about in my outreach to him.  I found that to be a rare yet gracious way to engage with his community. He acknowledged that this would be a tough election. He mentioned that his dream for Charlotte would be a “10 minute” neighborhood where all residents had key services available within walking distance.  He says he wants to incentivize more construction of vital services like health care near more diverse neighborhoods. He also said that he is not inclined to raise taxes given the increases in property values, but that the county is entrusted with funding many critical services including schools, courts and parks.  I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 74, Black, Democrat). 

**Tatyana Thulien**. Thulien is a Ukranian immigrant who moved to the US in 1998 and Charlotte in 2011.   She has been a singer, journalist and teacher in her time in the US. She says that county residents need to have a “genuine voice for their needs and issues.” She mentioned fair property taxes and public health as two key issues of importance to her.  She mentioned being dismayed at the amount of money spent on CMS but without strong results to show for it. She also mentioned that she wants “our faith not to be humiliated and abandoned.” As she grew up in the former Soviet Union, she says that “socialism is not making everyone equal.” She is the mother of two.

I reached out to her a few times and had challenges getting in touch with her.  The email from the Board of Elections site bounced back.  When I submitted a question in the form field, I did receive a note back asking if she could email me responses but I never heard anything subsequent to that.  I gave her a C-/D+ for accessibility and responsiveness as a result.  (White, Republican)

**Leigh Altman**. Altman is a public interest attorney and an incumbent on the board. She was also an Assistant Attorney General in the state of Georgia many years ago. Altman’s key issues include innovative job initiatives, a strong mental health system, equity in public schools, expanded mass transit options, better funded parks and greenways, LGBTQ rights, a science-based response to the pandemic and transparency in government. She also mentions reducing gun violence. She has talked about women’s reproductive rights issue as well on her website during the primary, but that content appears to have been removed.

Altman wrote me back in short but direct sentences soon after I pinged her on her website form field.  I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness. (Approx age 50s, White, Democrat)

### Board of Commissioners District 1

**Ross Monks.**  Monks is a retired executive from Ingersoll Rand.  In his retirement, he attended local government meetings and was quickly dismayed by what he saw as a lack of business acumen, particularly measurement and accountability.  He was surprised to hear that CMS didn’t do exit interviews with the 1000 teachers who departed during the pandemic, which he thought was important in understanding systemic causes of the departures.  He says “every business, school and place of worship is essential” on his website though in my conversation with him, he was primarily focused on schools, literacy rates and law enforcement. 

Monks invited me to have a call with him when I emailed him.  He spent 40 minutes on the phone with me talking about his background and his reasons for running (this is his first campaign.)  He is running because he believes that he is a “common sense servant leader who can bring best practices” to local government.  He believes the most important issues in the county are to fix schools and to get more students up to a grade-level reading standard, to fix the Sheriff’s department which is understaffed, and to manage the county tax level given that there has been “a 48% increase in residential property valuations.”  He says he was an independent until he decided to run, and then decided to run as Republican because it was impossible to have a serious candidacy as an unaffiliated candidate.  He doesn’t believe that this position in particular is ideological in nature.  He said that he likes his opponent as a person but that she is lacking a business background and is much more focused on environmental issues, which Monks believes are “secondary to education.” I found him very approachable and pragmatic and gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 60, White, Republican)

**Elaine Powell.**  Powell is currently an incumbent on the board. She is currently serving her second term. She says she is a “champion of environmental stewardship” and that she has been a volunteer and active in the community for over 30 years.  She says on her website she can’t stand bullies and that she’s inclusive.  She is a native of Delaware and moved to Charlotte in the late 1980s.

I did not hear back from her and gave her an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Incumbent, Age 59, White, Democrat)

### Board of Commissioners District 2

**Vilma Leake.**  I didn’t reach out to her as she is uncontested and appears to be an unshakeable institution in her district.  I have heard Charlotte residents describe her as “mean” and “vindictive” but she also appears to be fiercely loyal to her constituents.  She was recently in the news for allegedly trying to communicate with a judge about a juvenile case of one of her constituents. She denied the allegations.  (Incumbent, Black, Democrat)

### Board of Commissioners District 3

**George Dunlap**. Dunlap is an incumbent who has served 8 terms on the board and is currently the chairman of the board. Prior to his time as commissioner, he served 14 years on the CMS Board.  He was born in Pineville and graduated from South Mecklenburg High School. He is a former CMPD officer. The top issues listed on his website are economic development, education and affordable housing. He believes in investing in Business Investment Grants to bring jobs into the community, and that CMS should provide a “high quality education for all of our children.”

I emailed him and he directed me to resources that he said had interviews that answered my questions but I couldn’t find very much information on those websites, and none that directly answered my questions.  His website also had no contact information either so I gave him a C+/B- for accessibility and responsiveness. Many of his responses were non-specific and bland.  (Age 66, Black, Democrat)

**Dianna Benson.** Benson is active in the Mecklenburg County Black Republican Club. She does not appear to have a campaign website.  She said in an Observer interview that one of her accomplishments that she is most proud of is graduating college.  She wrote me back within 48 hours of my initial email to her.  She said that she in in favor of low property taxes and that it is worth the County Commission exploring “holding the purse strings” from CMS as a way to ensure that Commission has “a say in what our children are learning.”  She also said that “our parks and recreation should be funded and improved to make our parks more enjoyable for both children as well as adults.” Because she had no easily available contact information and she was curt but direct in her responses, I gave her a C+/B- for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 63, Black, Republican)

### Board of Commissioners District 4

**Ray Fuentes.**  Fuentes moved to Charlotte 35 years ago and was a former employee of Charlotte Water and Coca-Cola.  The key issues cited on his website are community safety and safety in schools, a clean environment, and lower property taxes. He served for 9 years on the Mecklenburg County Air Quality Commission.

When I emailed him, he promptly and politely wrote me back to say that he would follow up.  I didn’t hear back from him so gave him a C-.  (Age 58, Hispanic, Republican)

**Mark Jerrell.**  Jerrell is an incumbent on the board. His bio says that he is “committed to building bridges and breaking down barriers and ensuring that resources are accessible for our most vulnerable residents.”  His key issues are affordable housing, college and career readiness, and economic mobility.  Though he has been on the board for two terms, I didn’t find much more about his positions or projects.  He is a father of two young girls.   

Jerrell also quickly wrote me back and said he would respond with more details but I didn’t hear back.  He listed an additional way to contact him on his website so I gave him a B- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, Age 52, Black, Democrat)

### Board of Commissioners District 5

**Laura Meier.**  Meier is currently serving on the board representing District 5 since 2020. She lists “equitable schools,” “housing” and “parks and recreation” on her website as her areas of advocacy.  She also mentions mental health and safe neighborhoods.  She is a former teacher of at-risk youths and a graduate of App State University. She was a leader of the Charlotte Women’s March.

She responded to me quickly but seemed skeptical of why I was gathering this information. She responded to me with 3 sentences a few days later.  I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness because she provided multiple ways to contact her and she responded quickly but the content of her responses seemed shallow. (Incumbent, Age 53, White, Democrat)

**Matthew Ridenhour.**  Ridenhour is a former county commissioner (2012-18) and has run for a number of different public offices since then.  He is generally well-regarded as a strong public servant in Mecklenburg County.  His website showcases beautiful parks, safe streets and great schools. In an Observer interview, he mentions food deserts and “whether a child has a full stomach” as issues that local government should address.  Regarding taxes, he wants a “fair, equitable and transparent revaluation next year.”  He also cited defeating the MLS/Memorial Stadium deal which he said would cost taxpayers $100MM.  He is the father of two elementary school age children.

Ridenhour wrote me back very quickly and was polite in his tone and responses. I asked him about the single-family zoning changes in Charlotte and he responded that “I lean toward being in favor of removing the single-family zoning, though I would say I only very lightly and cautiously support it.”  I also asked him about public charging stations for electric vehicles and he said he wasn’t in favor of using county dollars for it because “those who own electric vehicles—a demographic that tends to be upper middle class or wealthy.”  He did however support public electric vehicles for transportation. I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness.(Age 45, White, Republican)

### Board of Commissioners District 6

**Susan Rodriguez-McDowell.**  She was one of the only commissioners who disagreed with the board about holding back CMS money back in 2021. At the time, that action was viewed as a stunt by many local parents who felt that students would be the biggest losers in that standoff. She did respond to me after a few days but was thoughtful in her response.  I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness.

**Jeremy Brasch.**  Brasch says he is running to provide choice.  There was very little information about him and I didn’t even see a website. He has unsuccessfully run for the board twice before.  He did however respond immediately to my email and was most vocal when talking about the single family housing zoning changes that were in the news recently (homeowners can now build multifamily units in single family neighborhoods; this is an attempt to relieve housing shortages.)  I gave him a B for accessibility and responsiveness, mainly because he appears to have no website. 

## Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education

This is a non-partisan election though I did cite party affiliation where I found it.  CMS has been plagued by a number of issues ranging from low student performance to teacher retention problems to gun incidents and assaults on teachers, as well as missteps in funding allocation, as well as turnover in its superintendent.  Nearly everyone who responded to me said that the current Board has failed in its duties, including incumbents currently on the Board. 

### Board of Education District 1

District 1 has the greatest number of candidates.  It represents the northern-most part of the county.

**Rhonda Cheek.**  Cheek has been an incumbent on the board for 13 years.  She initially said  she wasn’t going to run again but then changed her mind recently.  She says on her website that her key priorities are “setting high expectations,” “improving school safety” (including body scanners),  “allocating resources efficiently” and “protecting neighborhood schools.”  She is also a registered nurse and real estate broker.  She is an advocate of increasing magnet programs to give families choice. Creek is a registered Republican.

Cheek wrote me back relatively quickly.  She was very terse in her responses.  She did mention that the average tenure for superintendents nationally is 5 years and that it would be worth exploring a retention bonus at the 5 year mark.  I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Incumbent, White, Republican)

**Melissa Easley.**  Easley is a former teacher and parent of two CMS students.  She says her goals are to “repair relationships with our teachers, staff and community,” to support the “lowest performing schools” and focus on “high academic achievement.” 

Easley listed a few different ways to contact her on her website and responded to me after my 2nd email.  She was polite and apologetic in her response back to me and her responses were non-inflammatory and diplomatic.  She said that regarding superintendent turnover, “consistency is something that is needed in CMS” and that she preferred to stay focused on the future.  Regarding parental involvement, she said that the board needs to “get a good sense of a variety of different groups and connections.” I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 39, White, Democrat)

**Hamani Fisher.** Fisher is a pastor who appears to have 3 children (based on a photo on his website), and said he is running because he is “concerned about the future of Mecklenburg County’s children, families and overall well-being.” Fisher has “accountability, transparency and restored trust” as the key issues listed on his website. In interviews, he has said that collaboration between parents and schools is the solution to safety issues as well as student performance.  With respect to specific initiatives, there are very few listed on his website and I did not hear back from him in spite of reaching out twice.  I gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 46, Black, Democrat)

**Bill Fountain.**  Fountain is a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, former high school math teacher and amateur author. He believes it is critical to “enforce student discipline for productive classrooms” and wants to “hold the superintendent accountable for student performance.”  He believes “God made us male and female” and that sexuality is not a “pathological choice.”  On his website he also made remarks saying that he found it offensive to assign pornographic books for students to read, that dictating mask-wearing was wrong and that schools taught false notions about “our shared history.”

Fountain held back nothing in his email back to me where he passionately communicated why he is running and what his grievances are with the current board.  He said he is “the only one candidate challenging the woke culture in CMS.” He said that Cornelius Elementary and North Meck HS both needed attention in addition to the schools in the south part of the county.  He said “the eight women on the board failed in hiring Ernest Winston” and that “this woke cancer involves blaming white people for black and brown students low test scores, thus robbing the black and brown children of their self-worth.” He wrote me back within two days of my reaching out, which was faster than any of the other candidates from District 1 that I emailed.   I gave him an B- for his accessibility and responsiveness mainly because his responses, while candid, were disparaging toward minorities and the women on the CMS board. (Age 79, White, Unaffiliated)

**Ro Lawsin.**  Lawsin is a first-generation Filipino-American who said he is running to increase safety and security in schools. He has 3 children who are or were in CMS and said that “new leadership is desperately needed” in District 1. He believes the north part of the county should have been better represented in the last bond referendum. He received negative media attention when he was dismissed as the tennis coach at Hough High School for an altercation with a student. In an Observer interview, he said his father committed suicide in 2019 and he is living out his father’s dream.  He did not respond to me after I reached out twice.  I gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 53, Asian, Republican)

### Board of Education District 2

This is the west central part of Charlotte (around Steele Creek).

**Juanrique Hall**.  Hall does not appear to have a website but according to the Observer, he has a “lengthy criminal history.” His past record includes fleeing and eluding arrest, disorderly conduct and reckless driving, among dozens of other offenses. He claims he was a CMS football coach but CMS said he was never on the district payroll.  He believes his life experience is crucial to helping others. He says he is the only candidate serving students “not sides.” I did not find contact information for him until late in the process so did not reach out to him in time for this writeup. (Age 50, Black, Democrat)         

**Monty Witherspoon.**  Witherspoon ran for an at-large seat on the school board in 2019.  He is a pastor at Steele Creek AME Zion Church and was a substitute teacher in NYC. He lists student achievement, a safe learning environment, support for teachers, strong community coalitions and system-wide accountability and transparency on his site as his key issues.  When he last ran for school board (an at-large seat in 2019, he placed 5th in that election), he advocated for more AP classes.  He appears to have two young children.  He has a doctorate degree and graduated from Olympic High School. (Age 43, Black, Democrat)

I gave him a solid B.  He responded after my 2nd email to him and sent me back high level but not very specific responses.  He said that the high turnover of CMS superintendents was due to “faulty leadership by the Board” and that regarding parent involvement, “academic success and well-being of all students should be the focus.”

**Thelma Byers-Bailey.** Byers-Bailey did not have a website but she is an incumbent on the school board (the vice-chair in fact) who has served since 2013. She is an attorney and a graduate of West Charlotte High School.  She is a grandmother. She said she fought to keep the IB magnet programs at Harding and West Charlotte High Schools when others wanted to eliminate them.

I gave her an A- for accessibility and responsiveness.  Her only contact information was on the CMS website, but she did write back a thoughtful response, particularly on some of the notorious missteps of CMS, including the hiring of superintendents and[ the see-through backpack fiasco](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/education/cms-clear-backpacks-bid-auction-sale/275-fd8549d0-5b4d-4537-88c4-f23257b0cd61).  (Age 79, Black, Democrat) 

### Board of Education District 3

This is the north west part of Charlotte, south of District 1.

**Greg “Dee” Rankin.**  Rankin is a Charlotte native who says that the CMS Board “needs a candidate that is not focused on politics…but on improving student outcomes.”  He was a former educator in CMS and mentor for youth.  He says that when he attended CMS, “it was known around the country as a model district.”  But as it became more segregated racially and socio-economically, that has changed. He lists education, equity and experience on his website as his campaign philosophy.  He is the father of 3. I did not hear back from him and gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 47, Black, Democrat)

**Steven Rushing.**  Rushing describes himself as the owner of a kid taxi company and a “regular, everyday father.”  He listed jury duty as his previous civic involvement. In an Observer interview, he said his idea for improving safety was a “dads on duty” program and said that removing cell phones from classrooms would improve the achievement gap. He does not appear to have a website and he did not respond to my email. I gave him an F for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 48, “Half Latin American,” Democrat)

### Board of Education District 4

This is the south western part of Charlotte, including East Meck High School and the town of Mint Hill.

**Carol Sawyer.**  Sawyer is an incumbent on the board and was first elected in 2017. She is a former CMS parent, former CMS employee and currently a volunteer. She says that the NC General Assembly should raise educator pay.  In an Observer interview, she said that regarding school safety, “I support the continued expansion of restorative practices rather than exclusionary discipline for all but the most serious infractions in our schools.”  She also mentioned in the interview that she believes in strong leaders who support equity and anti-racism. I did not hear back from Sawyer and gave her an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Incumbent, Age 64, White).

**Stephanie Sneed.**  Sneed is an attorney and CMS parent. Sneed ran for an at-large seat in 2019 when she placed 4th.  She also unsuccessfully ran against Carol Sawyer in 2017.  She says in an Observer interview that one of the reasons she is running is that “District 4 has now become the lowest performing, with 65% of schools deemed as low performing. It is time for new leadership that will have a laser focus on student outcomes and ending educational gaps.” She is endorsed by the Black Political Caucus of Mecklenburg County and Congresswoman Alma Adams as well as 3 county commissioners (Pat Cotham, Leigh Altman and Mark Jerrell). I reached out to Sneed but did not hear back from her; I gave her an F for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 47, Black, Democrat)

**Clara Witherspoon.**  Witherspoon is a former school counselor and CMS employee. The issues she cites on her website are “effective leadership” and “supporting success for all students.”  There appeared to be little information about her online.  Witherspoon (no relation to Monty Witherspoon who is running for Commissioner) wrote me back with very high level responses to my questions that made me question if she understood the responsibilities of the board.  I asked her about her thoughts on zoning for the new South Charlotte high school and she responded, “My campaign focus is equity and equality for all students regardless of the school.”  That said, she did write me back.  I gave her a B for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 65, Black, Democrat)

### Board of Education District 5

This includes Matthews and much of South Charlotte.

**Lisa Cline.**  Cline is retired now but was a longtime CMS employee (teacher and assistant principal) who is campaigning on the slogan of “reclaiming education.”  Her website has her issues being tackling learning loss, ensuring that graduates are career ready, and creating good communication between parents and schools. While this election is non partisan, Cline is a registered Republican.  She said she was involved in the “fight to save Old Providence Park when CMS wanted to build a high school there.”

I gave her an A for accessibility and responsiveness.  I wrote her on a Saturday and I received her response back by Monday morning. She offered to also do an in-person meet and greet with me and any other parents I knew if I wanted. She said that her opponent “is supported by a number of public officials, mainly Democrats” and that “I was one of the people who worked long hours with teachers and students to raise the scores” when CMS won the Broad Prize. She says she is the best candidate because she is someone “ who has worked on the East, South, and West sides of Charlotte and was a parent at the same time.” For the full text of her responses, see my spreadsheet and search “Cline.”  (Age 62, White, Republican)

**Trent Merchant.**  Merchant is a former teacher and theater department director. He is a Charlotte native and his 3 children are or were CMS students.  He was a former CMS board member several years ago and says that as “an experienced executive search consultant” he is well-positioned to help the search for the next CMS superintendent. On his website he says that when schools that talk about Jim Crow laws, race-based slavery and secession by the Confederate states, that “is not CRT (critical race theory).”  His website had much more comprehensive information that suggested solid insight into current CMS issues.  He is currently registered as an unaffiliated voter and is endorsed by a number of current and former city and county elected officials. 

I gave Merchant an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness.  He had multiple ways to contact him on his website and wrote me back without a few hours of my emailing him.  He directly answered my questions and had some creative thoughts about the school assignments for the new South Charlotte high school which will probably affect District 5 and 6 the most.  See the spreadsheet (link at top) for the full text of his responses.  (Age 52, White, Unaffiliated)

### Board of Education District 6

I actually think this is the most competitive district because there is a long-standing incumbent who is broadly respected within the community and his two challenges appear to also be bright, capable, caring individuals.  This district includes Ballantyne and Pineville and stretches across the entire southern part of the county.

**Summer Nunn.**  Nunn is a mother of 2 CMS children in elementary school and a marketing executive who has worked at a number of regional companies including Red Ventures.  She indicates that the board should have parents with children in elementary school which is “45% of our students who are facing very different challenges than they did 5 to 10 years ago.”  She serves on her school’s Parent Teacher Leadership team.  She said she has navigated Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and 504s.  She is one of the few candidates who bought paid search ads on Google (likely a byproduct of her professional marketing background.)

When I reached out to her late one evening, she emailed me back the following morning and seemed to be very committed to gathering feedback from the community, particularly on issues like zoning for the new high school in South Charlotte. She said she is “not in favor of censoring materials or teachers' ability to adapt the curriculum to best reach our students just because a parent or a few of them are complaining.” She agrees that CMS has “a leadership problem.”  She said that she’s heard from teachers that the leadership changes with the superintendent mean that priorities change which inhibits an idea “to get off the ground or work.” I gave her an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness. (Age 39, White, Democrat)

**Sean Strain.**  Strain is an incumbent on the board and has served since 2017.  He lists his priorities as “high expectations and accountability,” “great leaders” and “equity.”  He is the father of 4 CMS students. He wants a strong network of neighborhood schools “supplemented by a robust menu of magnet and choice schools.”

Strain was perhaps the most responsive candidate of everyone that I connected with.  I gave him an A+ for accessibility and responsiveness.  He is clearly passionate about CMS and has a very strong perspective on where mistakes were made in the past. He believes that he has a reputation as the “voice of reason” and is “not clouded by the various other social issues and agendas that come knocking on a weekly basis.” He said that the Board and the CMS Superintendent need to “stop being politicians” and making political decisions “popular with some of their constituents  (e.g., the radical use of age-inappropriate materials in the classroom, lowering standards and expectations for teachers and students)” which was causing the noise. (Age 50, White, Republican)

**Michael Watson.**  Watson is the father of 2 CMS high school students. He is an IT professional and a small business owner. The key issues listed on his website are “school safety,” “administrator and teacher retention and recruitment,” “collaboration” and “transparency and communication.” He said that he was originally part of the community discussion around the Rea Farms STEAM program which had concerns from Polo Ridge parents, but ultimately “Rea Farms has proven to be a great school.”

Watson also wrote me back quickly and described himself as a highly involved parent who has served on the parent-teacher groups at a number of schools in his district. Regarding superintendent turnover, he said, “the Board has failed in one of its more critical duties and that is to find and select competent effective leadership for our district.”  He acknowledged that the race would be a tough one.  He has fewer ways to contact him on his website than the other candidates though his responses to me were thoughtful and well-written. He believes that one of the reasons for overcrowding in District 6 is that “we aren’t enforcing residency rules strictly enough.” I gave him an A for accessibility and responsiveness.  (Age 41, Black, Democrat)

## Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor

This is the second non-partisan race though I cited party affiliation where it was publicly available. Citizens can cast their vote for 2 candidates every 4 years. Carter and Bleiweis are incumbents and are both incredibly passionate about the environment.  I gave them each an A for accessibility and responsiveness.  No summary could do them justice as they both had extensive responses to my questions; Carter wrote nearly a whole page about her background, her experience in conservation and her accomplishments. 

As for the other candidates, one is a convicted felon who has run unsuccessfully for this role before.  The other two have little to no information online about their candidacies, which should be enough to dismiss them as serious contenders.  There is an opportunity for two write-ins as well.         

**Nancy Carter**.  She is currently the vice-chair of the board and has been on it since January 2012.  Prior to her 10 years on this board, she was on the Charlotte City Council for 12 years. She said she stepped down from the City Council (which she loved) because “of 11:40pm calls” and the fact that it was a part-time job but demanded 60-80 hours a week.  She is running again for this board because “I love what I do in this position.” She grew up loving forests and clear, running water. She said she lobbied hard and got money recently from the NC General Assembly for removal of debris from streams, a proactive measure to reduce flooding.  (Late 70s, Incumbent, White)

**Alonzo Hill.**  There was little information available about Hill but he does appear to be on the steering committee of a local non-profit. He appears to be the founder of a holistic product company selling skincare products  It is unclear if this is the[ same candidate](https://www.ucityfamilyzone.com/team/hill%2C-alonzo-), so if anyone knows, please confirm.  (Est Age 56, Black, Democrat)

**Tigress Sydney Acute McDaniel.**  McDaniel is a perennial candidate who has consistently run for something since I first created these writeups several years ago.  She has never won, nor come close.  She was convicted of identity theft in her past and has shared long-winded explanations of the circumstances leading to her conviction online.  This is at least the second time I have known her to run for this position.  She has no clear background in or passion for the environment as far as I could tell and is not a candidate who should be taken seriously.

**Hunter Wilson**.  There is little available about this candidate.  There are two possibilities I think: one listing for a Hunter Wilson on social media is a rafting instructor at the US Whitewater Center. This is the other: https://lakewylie.guru/about/ Can someone confirm if any of these people are the candidates? 

**Barbara Bleiweis.** Bleiweis is the current Chair of the board of supervisors and says she is running again “because there is still so much to do!” She is involved in a Farmland Preservation Plan as well as outreach programs such as soil education for the community, and Charlotte’s Tree Canopy Action Plan.   She is currently in her first term. (Incumbent, Age 65, Democrat) 

## Bond Referenda

There are three bond referenda that Charlotte city residents will have the opportunity to approve or reject.  According to the Charlotte city government’s website, Charlotte has an AAA credit rating.  The first proposal is for **City of Charlotte Transportation Bonds in the amount of $146MM.**  The second is **City of Charlotte Housing Bonds in the amount of $50MM** for low income housing.  The third is **City of Charlotte Neighborhood Improvement Bonds in the amount of $30MM.**  The city has requested bonds in the amount of $1B before (for schools) so this seems modest in comparison.

I don't know if the city is slacking off on picking up the materials or if something else is to blame. Regardless, I'd like to find a different place to go so that I know I'll actually be able to drop off my recycling whenever I make the trip.

"Alright CLT, let's do this. FOOD: What's GOOD, What's BAD, What's Under/Over/Meta-apreciated?","I feel like the first thing people in CLT want to talk about when they talk about the city is food. OK, I can work with that. 

Amelie's: I basically live there. I mean, honestly, I live less-than-a-short-distance-that-is-ambiguous-enough-so-you-can't-stalk-me from there. You know it's good, even if you've never been there. Chocolate, soup, baguettes, whatever. Eat this shit now.

The Liberty: Not exactly a ""best kept secret"" sort of place, but I regularly run into people who have never heard of it. Very gastropub with updated classics like pork-belly sliders and probably the best burger I've ever had. Seasonal menu takes itself seriously, but not too seriously. Great beer selection, and they'll pair beer to food.

LuLu: In the month or so I've been reading r/Charlotte, I've seen LuLu mentioned probably 5 times. Great French/Italian, nice staff, cozy atmosphere. Decent price for the level of cuisine. Heard good things about brunch, never had it. Seasonal menu. Duck and smoked eggplant lasagna are great.

Hickory House: Hickory House? What's that? Never heard of it? Bitches, please. I had driven past probably 50-60 times without giving it a second thought. It's on North Tryon, a bit before the split with University City, and it's a windowless box. Seriously. No windows. It's also fucking OLD. The decor is literally various wood cutting implements, and small cover wagons over the wall sconces. But who fucking cares, there's a fireplace the size of a Volkswagen dumping delicious hickory smell into your nose and onto the fabulous meat. Fucking god, all the time I wasted at Mac's.

Speaking of old ass dives, have you been to Brook's? It's on Brevard, BEHIND the Highland Mill apartment building. It's literally a shack. Like, so small they use a semi-trailer to store things. Won best ""old school"" burger in Charlotte. Elusive for 2 reasons: only open from 7 - 2 on weekdays, and only takes cash. Seriously, I lived across the street from it for 3 years and only ate there twice during that time.

Dim Sum: On Central. Good, relatively authentic Chinese in general, but as the name would imply, fabulous Dim Sum on Sundays. For the uninitiated, Dim Sum is like Chinese Tapas that comes on a steamer cart and you eat until you either shit your pants or start to hallucinate.

Lang Van: Last one, I promise. I didn't even like Vietnamese food before coming here. It's on Shamrock, just past Eastway. Nicest people ever. Good food, fast, cheap. Great pho. After going there, I found out that more than half of my coworkers went there regularly... they just assumed I knew.

Best Places To Live In The Charltote Area?,"Hey all,

My wife and I are considering moving and it seems that we are choosing the Charlotte area of NC. (We're now living in Massachusetts). Long story short, we have a ton of family from Northern SC as well as Charlotte, but the cost of living and housing is much more manageable down there. Also, escape from winter!

The thing is, neither of us have been. We're going early October. We want to know some good areas as well as places to avoid. We've heard of good places like Huntersville and Cornelius. We've heard of places to stay away from such as Gastonia. We're also wary of living \*in\* the city. We'd like to live within 45 minutes of Charlotte for commuting purposes.

Please let us know what you think of some of these suburbs and please include towns that are technically in SC right over the border.

Thanks for your help!

(Note: So far, I've looked at and liked towns such as Denver, Fort Mill, Kannapolis, Concord and borderline warming up to Dallas, but feedback is welcomed.)

EDIT: Also, while I said I'm wary of Charlotte itself, I'm not \*completely\* opposed against it. Feel free to let me know of neighborhoods that you'd say I'd be kicking myself in the rear for not considering.",1594948919.0,KyronAWF,"Best Places To Live In The Charltote Area? Hey all,

What do you think?

I plan on breaking down the sections into neighborhoods. Then there is a easy reference point for people to see where any particular apartment is. South-Dilworth-Latta Pavilion for example.

Start with the 485 donut and work outwords.

Eh?

South Charlotte

Touchstone Village

Features: Secluded in a woodsy area right next to the greenway so it's great for walking/running and recreation. Location is close to Ballantyne, Carolina Place Mall, and the Arboretum. 15-20 minutes to the airport. [1] Touchstone

Andover Woods

Features: Overall good reveiws and is located near park road as well as south blvd with public transportation. Prices are reasonable for those on a budget and offers things such as a work out room.

Do not choose River Birch apartments off Sharon. I personally made the mistake of living there for a short period. Every time it rained the ceiling leaked. This is also in a borderline area nestled between little Mexico and the ghetto so don't be fooled by apartments touting 'close to south park!'.

For those wanting a slightly more upscale residence I highly suggest taking a slow drive along Providence near Queens College as you will find hundreds of apartments for rent and the location is fantastic in regards to biking, jogging, and shops.

A secret for those seeking a place near uptown but on a budget is to drive down Crescent Ave. There are numerous apartments for rent as well as a few condos and duplexes. I personally lived at one that was near 2k sq ft. and paid 1k a month. The location can not be beat as it is just a block or two away from Presbyterian Hospital and maybe a 5 minute drive to Plaza Midwood. For those that get discouraged with the cost of the area, fear not, I currently rent a 6 bedroom house that is around 3k sq ft. and pay $1200 a month. I have found that sometimes you stumble across an owner that just takes a shine to you or perhaps they are a bit eccentric.

I think this is all I have for now. Everyone else please add their experiences and words of wisdom to make this a true resource for those seeking an apartment.

My expertise is uptown living. There are numerous places to find very nice one, two, and three bedroom apartments, condos, or townhouses. These places are going to be a bit more expensive, but if you work uptown then it is worth it. Parking will cost you close to $150 per month if you decide to commute, so be sure to include that in your calculations.

1bdrm rent will be $1200-$1400

2bdrm rent will be $1800-$2400 (less for a 1bdrm with office/bdrm)

Condos:

The Avenue

Catalyst

230 Tryon

Trademark (no concierge)

5th and Poplar (beware of HOA dues if buying)

Apartment Complexes:

Camden Cottonmill

Post Uptown

Post Gateway (not the nicest, someone got shot around there last month)

The Arbors

Townhomes:

There are tons of townhomes in 4th ward. I wouldn't look at any other areas except maybe 1st ward. Peruse craigslist to find these.

There are lots of other buildings in uptown, mostly in 2nd and 3rd ward that are ok, but your walking times will be greater and they are not the nicer part of uptown. In general, the closer to trade and tryon or 5th and tryon the better.

*The Vue - probably the nicest condo highrise in Charlotte and possibly the Southeast. None are for rent and they are greatly overpriced so not included in this overview.

Try SteeleCroft Farm. It's located beside a really nice shopping center and is close to I77 and 485.

[–]Howard_Campbell (_) [+1] 2 points 2 months ago (2|0)

The rental market in charlotte will put you anywhere for $1600. The catalyst is great. They have luxory apartments and the best grilling/ pool deck in town. You may also want to look at ""the circle"" apartments on south. The atherton (ashton sp?) on tremont and south

[–]WomanMonster (_) 2 points 2 months ago (2|0)

I lived in Camden Cotton Mills in uptown for a while. Around $1200/month at the time for an unfurnished studio. I think prices have gone down, but I felt it was a little overpriced for what they had. The cool part was at how no sound came through the concrete walls or floors. Also, with my work and a grocery store right there (Harris Teeter) I didn't have to ever use my car. For my mid-20's, it was a slightly older crowd than I expected (early 30's mostly). If I did it again, I'd consider NoDA. Some of the newer places closer to Trade & Tryon were also pretty competitive. The train running through the Northwest part of town in the middle of the night was a bit annoying, as were the random drunks yelling outside, but that's any city. Just spend some time walking around and you'll find some great deals!

[–]anthony955 (_) [+2] 1 point 2 months ago (1|0)

I've noticed if it's over a dollar a square foot then it better have good amenities and/or great location. There's quite a few apartments around here that meet that.

If you find the right place at the right time you'll get a steal. I'm paying $830 a month for a 1300 sqft 2br with a 300 sqft garage and a 230 sqft deck, full price is $1110. It's in Piper Glen which is one of the high end neighborhoods of Charlotte but I wouldn't call it great unless you're over 40 or have a family. In my case it's neither but I couldn't pass up the price.

[–]teh_kyle (_) 2 points 2 months ago (2|0)

Which apartment complex is this at? I'm currently in the University area at a pretty nice apartment complex - 1440 sq. ft. for $860, great neighborhood, good floor plans and all that jazz. However, its going to be like, 40 mins from my new job (if you include traffic), Piper Glen looks to be only about 15 mins (new job is on Arrowood). If the stars align and i have the oppourtunity to move before my new job starts, that looks to be an area that i would look at.

[–]anthony955 (_) [+2] 1 point 2 months ago (1|0)

The Fairways. They're actually unsold condos that were converted into apartments. I have the larger of the 2br models which I think just means I have a linked garage and enormous deck while others have two small decks and possibly a separate garage. I think the only thing ""wrong"" with them is they seem to be around 15 years old so they don't have any of the modern style other luxury apartments do like granite counters. I do have a wood burning fireplace and 12 foot vaulted ceilings so it feels like a one story house.

The distance to Arrowood isn't bad at all but you would likely save time taking Woodlawn to Johnston/Park Road and bypass that clusterfuck between 77 and 51.

Another good thing is that Trader Joe's is next door and we're connected to that huge greenway that runs across most of southeast Charlotte if you bike/run. It's practically in the dead center of Ballantyne so it's less than 10 minutes to pretty much everything except maybe plaza midwood and noda. I don't work for them or anything but I'll be glad to show you around so you can skip dealing with the office people for a viewing.

I have a super nice 1 br with 10 months left on my lease at Elizabeth square that I'm looking for someone to take over my lease if interested, 1035, cable tv and Internet included. I can send pictures. 4th floor, looks over the pool, and e square is awesome. I moved to clt for a job and just had a better offer from a company in chicago (where I moved from) so I'm trying to get back.

"UPDATE: How North Carolina gets back to work - ""Hey Jeff, you know we can't stay home forever, right?"" - Sen. Jeff Jackson"," 

https://preview.redd.it/mmry0h1vh8s41.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa91de79ffbd3f577d6ea41db063bfea42cad665

**CURRENT STATS (as of 4/11 at 2:00 p.m.)**

* 4,300+ cases (although we are still rationing tests)
* 87 deaths
* 12th day since the first full day of the stay home order. Hopefully, we will see that reflected in case numbers within the next few days.

https://preview.redd.it/9eeffeuwh8s41.jpg?width=853&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=517178aafef7fc93222154ab78b8f5228ed7bf4c

**“HEY JEFF - YOU KNOW WE CAN’T STAY HOME FOREVER, RIGHT?”**

Let’s talk about how North Carolina gets back to work.

And let’s skip the obvious stuff - like hand-washing and staying home if we’re sick.

To fully reopen, we’re going to need to know four things: Who’s sick, who’s not, who’s been sick, and who hasn’t.

(You don’t need multiple studies to know that, but if you want here are three: [1](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2020/04/03/482613/national-state-plan-end-coronavirus-crisis/), [2](https://ethics.harvard.edu/test-millions), [3](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/).)

That’s the information that will let us track and control future localized outbreaks (which are inevitable) without requiring wide-scale shutdowns.

It will also give the public confidence that it’s safe to become customers - not just employees - of restaurants, theaters, barber shops, airlines, hotels, sports arenas, food trucks, colleges and universities.

Having this information early is how South Korea was able to demolish the infection curve and reopen society much faster than any other country. And the way they got there was early, widespread testing - followed by aggressive contact tracing and isolation.

We missed the opportunity to get ahold of this on the front-end because we didn’t have that kind of widespread testing, and we didn’t have it for three reasons: a lack of test kits, a lack of related chemicals needed to use the test kits, and a lack of PPE needed to administer the tests.

But we can’t just call that a failure a move on. We actually have to solve the problem, only now it’s much bigger because the universe of those who are potentially infected has grown by several orders of magnitude.

One more factor: The testing can’t just be widespread - it also has to be rapid. Waiting ten days for a result isn’t particularly helpful when that person can easily infect dozens more while results are pending.

So let’s take a close look at what it will actually take to get rapid, widespread testing in North Carolina.

**MOLECULAR TESTING**

Broadly speaking, there are two types of tests: molecular and antibody.

The molecular tests are the ones we’ve been using. You take a swab from the back of someone’s nose or throat, you extract the RNA, then you see if it matches the COVID RNA.

We’ve done about 48,000 so far in North Carolina (that number includes private labs, which are currently doing the vast majority of the testing). We did about 5,000 yesterday.

https://preview.redd.it/ssiog1xvh8s41.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=270fa8cfe25ff96d48b1bdbaabfbf24f32685203

Molecular tests are highly accurate, but the global demand for them is so high that we’ve been plagued by a number of material shortages needed to perform them. The biggest shortage right now is the PPE needed to administer the test.

Our state has received three shipments from the National Strategic Stockpile totaling roughly 33% of our requested supply. Now the stockpile is nearly depleted and we’ve been told there will not be another shipment. In search for more, our state emergency management agency has submitted $125 million worth of bids on PPE to private manufacturers across the country but only a small fraction of those bids has been accepted. As has been widely reported, we are competing against other states and other hospital systems, and the competition is fierce. In better news, we have several manufacturers in North Carolina which have switched production to PPE for use by our front-line workers, so we hope that will help meet a growing share of the need.

That brings us to the molecular test kits (and related chemical supplies) themselves. We’ve seen a dramatic increase in private lab testing capacity in the last few weeks. But we’ve also seen real innovation. Most prominently, Abbott Labs now has a machine which will give a result in 15 minutes. It got FDA approval about ten days ago and is now probably the most in-demand medical device on earth.

Abbott says they can only make 400 of these machines per week for the foreseeable future. The federal government is in charge of allocating them to states. So far, most states - like North Carolina - have received 15 machines.

Let’s do some quick math. Over the next six weeks, Abbott should be able to make 2,400 of these machines. North Carolina has roughly 3% of the national population, so let’s say we get 3% of the machines (big assumption). That means we might get another 70 machines within the next six weeks, for a total of 85 machines. 85 machines working 24/7 at a rate of roughly 4 tests per hour = roughly 8,000 tests per day.

We tested 5,000 yesterday, so that would be a big jump for us. Even those assumptions are off by 25%, it would still double our current testing capacity. So getting more Abbott machines won't be the whole solution for us, but it’ll be a big piece.

And don't forget that other companies are also entering the space of rapid molecular testing. Just as no one was talking about the Abbott machine two weeks ago, the pace of innovation is such that two weeks from now we may have a new device to complement our Abbott machines.

Overall, it is very realistic to expect our state’s molecular testing capacity to grow significantly this month. HOWEVER, it may not be realistic to expect the kind of 10x growth in testing capacity which some say will be necessary to reopen without resurging the virus.

Which brings us to antibodies.

**ANTIBODY TESTING**

This is more controversial, in part because it started as an overly optimistic theory that tried to downplay the need for a strong response to the coronavirus.

The theory was this: What if it turns out that a massive share of the population has unknowingly been infected already, and has since recovered, and therefore we really don’t need to worry so much and we can go about our daily lives?

Ok… so how would you test that theory?

Here’s how: You would do widespread, random testing of the population to screen for antibodies that would indicate whether the virus had already been there and had been successfully fought off.

But in European cities that have been hit reasonably hard by COVID, random antibody testing hasn’t shown the type of widespread infection the theory posed - which frankly makes sense, given how new the virus itself is.

But there remains a case to make for the widespread use of antibody testing. Different companies report different rates of accuracy, but most report that their antibody tests can detect COVID over 90% of the time. The tests are at the lower end of the accuracy range in the early days of infection, before the body has had time to build up enough antibodies to register with the test. But any COVID test with an accuracy rate above 90% - *when the alternative may be no test at all* \- has to be seriously considered.

And while there is probably no chance that widespread, asymptomatic infection has already occurred, antibody testing at random across the state - or in certain vulnerable communities - might be helpful in identifying hot spots and letting us know where to focus our supply of molecular tests.

A notable concern is that antibody tests are more likely to error on the side of a false negative than a false positive. A false negative is worse, from a public health standpoint, than a false positive. The last thing we want is to tell someone they’re not infected and send them back into public only to find out later that they really were infected. Minimizing the risk of false negatives with antibody tests is an important piece of adopting them into regular use. (Note: A similar concern of false negatives also pertains to the Abbott test.)

The antibody test itself is very simple. It works by doing a finger prick and getting a blood sample. And you get the results in minutes.

Currently the FDA only recommends the use of antibody tests for broader screening purposes to determine who has already had COVID, but there’s an ongoing conversation about whether the test can also be accurate enough to also be used for diagnostic purposes - that is, to see if someone with symptoms is currently infected.

So let’s say we wanted to incorporate some form of widespread antibody testing into our state’s tool kit for virus detection. Now the question becomes, do we face the same shortages that we currently face with the molecular tests?

Right now, there are only a few companies which have FDA authorization to distribute antibody tests. These tests are not yet available in the tens of millions, which is what you would need to create a national supply from which North Carolina would stand to receive an amount big enough to make a dent. But things are evolving rapidly and there’s renewed interest in antibody testing at the national level so this situation could be very different in ten days. Yesterday, Dr. Fauci said, ""Within a period of a week or so, we're going to have a rather large number of \[antibody\] tests that are available.” He suggested that these antibody tests would be used in addition to the molecular tests.

**HOW MANY DAILY TESTS DO WE NEED TO PREVENT A RESURGENCE?**

No one knows. Estimates vary wildly. But certainly multiples of what we’re doing now.

Here are three pieces of good news to end on:

1. There’s a particular advantage to not being the first state to have a major outbreak. Several states - including New York, California, and Washington - are going to hit peak infection before we do. That means they’re going to be the first to experiment with how to reopen. They're going to be the first to decide how many tests, what kinds of tests, how to stagger the return to work, how to conduct effective monitoring, when to reopen schools. That means we'll have the opportunity to observe and learn some best practices before we’re in the same position. That's a big advantage for us - it's also a reason why you're not going to see a fully formed Grand Plan for reopening yet. We're not done learning from the experience of other states.
2. We know it’s going to be a heavy lift to get to the testing capacity we’re going to need in order to fully reopen, but the purpose of this post was to show you that there is a roadmap for getting there. Ramping up testing capacity doesn’t involve just pulling one lever - we have to do several different things simultaneously. But we've got a sense of what those things are and we're being realistic about what it's going to take.
3. **Most important:** There is a set of overwhelming incentives on the part of virtually everyone - state officials, politicians, business leaders, students, parents, workers - to reopen without causing a resurgence. Everyone is working toward the same goal. When that happens in our country - and it’s very, very rare - we tend to accomplish much more than we thought we could at the start.

**CURRENT STATS (as of 4/11 at 2:00 p.m.)**

* 4,300+ cases (although we are still rationing tests)
* 87 deaths
* 12th day since the first full day of the stay home order. Hopefully, we will see that reflected in case numbers within the next few days.

https://preview.redd.it/9eeffeuwh8s41.jpg?width=853&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=517178aafef7fc93222154ab78b8f5228ed7bf4c

**“HEY JEFF - YOU KNOW WE CAN’T STAY HOME FOREVER, RIGHT?”**

Let’s talk about how North Carolina gets back to work.

And let’s skip the obvious stuff - like hand-washing and staying home if we’re sick.

To fully reopen, we’re going to need to know four things: Who’s sick, who’s not, who’s been sick, and who hasn’t.

(You don’t need multiple studies to know that, but if you want here are three: [1](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2020/04/03/482613/national-state-plan-end-coronavirus-crisis/), [2](https://ethics.harvard.edu/test-millions), [3](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/).)

That’s the information that will let us track and control future localized outbreaks (which are inevitable) without requiring wide-scale shutdowns.

It will also give the public confidence that it’s safe to become customers - not just employees - of restaurants, theaters, barber shops, airlines, hotels, sports arenas, food trucks, colleges and universities.

Having this information early is how South Korea was able to demolish the infection curve and reopen society much faster than any other country. And the way they got there was early, widespread testing - followed by aggressive contact tracing and isolation.

We missed the opportunity to get ahold of this on the front-end because we didn’t have that kind of widespread testing, and we didn’t have it for three reasons: a lack of test kits, a lack of related chemicals needed to use the test kits, and a lack of PPE needed to administer the tests.

But we can’t just call that a failure a move on. We actually have to solve the problem, only now it’s much bigger because the universe of those who are potentially infected has grown by several orders of magnitude.

One more factor: The testing can’t just be widespread - it also has to be rapid. Waiting ten days for a result isn’t particularly helpful when that person can easily infect dozens more while results are pending.

So let’s take a close look at what it will actually take to get rapid, widespread testing in North Carolina.

**MOLECULAR TESTING**

Broadly speaking, there are two types of tests: molecular and antibody.

The molecular tests are the ones we’ve been using. You take a swab from the back of someone’s nose or throat, you extract the RNA, then you see if it matches the COVID RNA.

We’ve done about 48,000 so far in North Carolina (that number includes private labs, which are currently doing the vast majority of the testing). We did about 5,000 yesterday.

https://preview.redd.it/ssiog1xvh8s41.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=270fa8cfe25ff96d48b1bdbaabfbf24f32685203

Molecular tests are highly accurate, but the global demand for them is so high that we’ve been plagued by a number of material shortages needed to perform them. The biggest shortage right now is the PPE needed to administer the test.

Our state has received three shipments from the National Strategic Stockpile totaling roughly 33% of our requested supply. Now the stockpile is nearly depleted and we’ve been told there will not be another shipment. In search for more, our state emergency management agency has submitted $125 million worth of bids on PPE to private manufacturers across the country but only a small fraction of those bids has been accepted. As has been widely reported, we are competing against other states and other hospital systems, and the competition is fierce. In better news, we have several manufacturers in North Carolina which have switched production to PPE for use by our front-line workers, so we hope that will help meet a growing share of the need.

That brings us to the molecular test kits (and related chemical supplies) themselves. We’ve seen a dramatic increase in private lab testing capacity in the last few weeks. But we’ve also seen real innovation. Most prominently, Abbott Labs now has a machine which will give a result in 15 minutes. It got FDA approval about ten days ago and is now probably the most in-demand medical device on earth.

Abbott says they can only make 400 of these machines per week for the foreseeable future. The federal government is in charge of allocating them to states. So far, most states - like North Carolina - have received 15 machines.

Let’s do some quick math. Over the next six weeks, Abbott should be able to make 2,400 of these machines. North Carolina has roughly 3% of the national population, so let’s say we get 3% of the machines (big assumption). That means we might get another 70 machines within the next six weeks, for a total of 85 machines. 85 machines working 24/7 at a rate of roughly 4 tests per hour = roughly 8,000 tests per day.

We tested 5,000 yesterday, so that would be a big jump for us. Even those assumptions are off by 25%, it would still double our current testing capacity. So getting more Abbott machines won't be the whole solution for us, but it’ll be a big piece.

And don't forget that other companies are also entering the space of rapid molecular testing. Just as no one was talking about the Abbott machine two weeks ago, the pace of innovation is such that two weeks from now we may have a new device to complement our Abbott machines.

Overall, it is very realistic to expect our state’s molecular testing capacity to grow significantly this month. HOWEVER, it may not be realistic to expect the kind of 10x growth in testing capacity which some say will be necessary to reopen without resurging the virus.

Which brings us to antibodies.

**ANTIBODY TESTING**

This is more controversial, in part because it started as an overly optimistic theory that tried to downplay the need for a strong response to the coronavirus.

The theory was this: What if it turns out that a massive share of the population has unknowingly been infected already, and has since recovered, and therefore we really don’t need to worry so much and we can go about our daily lives?

Ok… so how would you test that theory?

Here’s how: You would do widespread, random testing of the population to screen for antibodies that would indicate whether the virus had already been there and had been successfully fought off.

What's on the Nov 5 Election Ballot (and some thoughts on candidates),"  

Please vote if you haven’t already. Here is the [election schedule](https://www.mecknc.gov/BOE/Documents/early%20voting%20calendar%20for%20MECK1911.pdf).  I talked to someone working at one of the early voting sites and he said that turnout has been slow so far. “Not enough controversy,” he sighed. Don’t let that deter you! Here is my latest recap of candidates for the upcoming election with my opinions as well (disagreement welcome in comments below--I want to hear other opinions to better inform myself.)  Quick note: I am in District 7 so I didn’t evaluate the other city council candidates who were not at-large but still running. 

**Mayoral Candidates**

**Vi Lyles** (incumbent): generally well-respected and known for being “pro Charlotte”; she’s been a civil servant working in the Charlotte government for decades; supported the RNC coming to Charlotte next year. It will be shocking if she doesn’t win as her competition is quite weak. 

**David Michael Rice:** Rice appears with regularity as a candidate for various roles in Charlotte (e.g. County Commissioner, City Council, mayor). He most recently ran for the role of Soil and Conservation District Supervisor in last year’s election.  He’s been unsuccessful to date and has said in the past he had [religious cable access TV show](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article41189799.html). He does not seem to be a “viable” opponent (no pun intended). He has also had a number of [financial problems](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article170248332.html) (bankrupty filings, liens against his property) dating back many years. 

**City Council at Large**

**Dimple Ajmera** (incumbent): a young relatively new council member; very liberal, endorsed by the Observer, very passionate in her positions related to women’s equality and economic development. 

**Julie Eiselt** (incumbent): also an experienced council member and is currently the Mayor Pro Tem. According to Charlotte’s city council website, “Julie had never envisioned a role in public office until a man tried to abduct her at gunpoint in 2007.  This led to her found Neighbors for a Safer Charlotte, to advocate for court-system resources and policies to make all Charlotte residents safer.” She has a reputation for being respected on the city council. 

**James (Smuggie) Mitchell** (incumbent) current member of the council having served on it for over 10 years; currently the chair of the economic development committee. He received the 2nd highest number of votes in the Democratic primary. 

**Joshua Richardson:** very young (age 21) candidate who describes himself as a Christian conservative. He said in an online survey that the person he looks up to most is Christ. There were a number of typos on his responses to [questions with Ballotopedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Joshua_Richardson) (e.g. “played lose (sic) with…”. He appears to have no work experience and there was no resume available online. (While he is the only at-large Republican candidate, that does NOT mean that the council is Republican-less. Ed Driggs represents District 7 and is a Republican who is running uncontested so there will absolutely still be a Republican on the council.) 

**Braxton Winston** (incumbent): relatively young and attended Davidson College and the elite New England prep school Phillips Andover; personal note—he was evidently trying to avoid being served divorce papers awhile back; his political career began when he was featured in the media during the Keith LaMott Scott riots and that put him in touch with community organizers; he realized he wanted to be involved in local politics then. His key issues are equity (housing equity, living wages for employees), access (mass transit, digital access), and interconnectedness (helping families particularly affected by the criminal justice system).  He received the highest number of votes in the Democratic primary. 

**City Council District 7**

**Ed Driggs** (incumbent): On his website he claims he wants “small, effective government” and believes that Charlotte has too much red tape for new businesses. Ed did not respond to my email so I am not sure how responsive he is to constituents or if he just didn’t get my emails. He also claims to have coffee every 7am on Fridays at the Ballantyne Hotel but I never saw him there when I went. He has been on the council for 6 years and positions himself as being one of the few Republican voices within the group. 

**Board of Education** 

**Annette Albright** (age 53): Albright was a behavior modification technician at Harding High School and reportedly was [assaulted by some students](https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/former-cms-worker-attacked-by-students-settles-with-district/733215605) which made the local news. She had filed a lawsuit against CMS for wrongful termination (she believes it was because she filed a worker’s comp claim) around that time and has run unsuccessfully for school board before. She appears to have several degrees in criminal justice. Regarding her platform, she says she wants to replace the Common Core and reduce overcrowding. (I will say as a CMS parent that the Common Core is not a bad thing—ensuring children have consistent education everywhere is a noble goal aspiring to equity. In my experience though, many schools cannot achieve the goals of the Common Core because the bar is high. I’d argue dumbing down our schools is not the answer though.) I’m also concerned that she wants more teachers fluent in the various languages of ESL students. Having had children in a language immersion program, it is very, very difficult to get multilingual teachers certified to teach public elementary school. That is a high bar, unnecessary and not the best use of limited school funds. 

**Elyse Dashew** (age 49, incumbent) Elyse’s children have been in CMS for years and she seems to be in the process of being groomed to be the Chairperson of the CMS board (she is Vice-Chairman now) but she also has been part of a group where transparency is missing. The current board mysteriously let Clayton Wilcox go with no explanation (the same board that presided over his pay raise just a few months prior). This incumbent board has also been light on answers with respect to details regarding school bonds and how it impacts current school programs. And in the school reassignment debate from a few years ago, details were also absent then as well. The board didn’t even shut down fears of parents who worried that their children may be reassigned to Huntersville if they lived in South Charlotte.  (I supposed vagaries are best because it gives less ammunition to oppose something.) She opposes vouchers for private schools and was the key leader behind the passing of the $1B school bond from a few years ago. We should demand more transparency from the board. Voting for Elyse probably won’t deliver that transparency. 

**Jennifer De La Jara** (age 45). Jennifer is a first-generation college graduate and wants to ensure “every child has access to quality public education.” She is the director of education at International House and a former ESL teacher in Cabarrus County. Her website states her support of education for “trades and IT” (where relevant in lieu of 4 year college degrees) and more Pre-K support. She has a number of endorsements including the Charlotte Observer and one of my favorite CMS educators, Justin Parmenter. She lives in Davidson now and pledges to support the views of the suburban Charlotte communities to have better access to CMS resources. 

**Gregory Denlea** (age 57). Former University of Phoenix teacher. Father of 3 who attended CMS. He also believes that CMS students face too much standardized testing. In an online survey, he also seemed to be dismayed by the “suburban flight” from CMS. I don’t understand why that is a problem if towns like Huntersville want to secede and become their own districts. His website states that he is particularly adamant about funding in the suburbs of towns like Mint Hill and Matthews (recall that those cities wanted to have their own magnets prioritizing residents which would be funded by Charlotte residents overall.) By my calculation, Huntersville, Matthews and Mint Hill have 13% of Charlotte’s population but likely pay 17% of the property taxes that fund the public schools; he has a point in trying to keep those suburbs within CMS.  

**Jenna Morehead** (age 48): Former school social worker who says she was the past president of a school board in another state (which she does not specify). She responded to an online survey somewhat quizzically. When asked what specific problems she saw with CMS, her answer was “I am currently not aware of specific issues or concerns.” Hmmm. She also says she is an advocate of free breakfast for students—something that CMS already provides. I really cannot recommend this candidate as she seems ill-informed about CMS’ issues. 

**Donna Parker-Tate** (age 68): Former educator (including school principal) and currently an educational consultant.  She had a lot of vague responses in an online survey but seems knowledgeable about CMS, charter schools and the differences between giving resources to low-performing schools while not hurting high-performing schools. 

**Jordan Pineda:** Former Teach for America teacher.  Much of his website talks about the gap in early education for children of color and opportunities provided to them. He says he wants to represent the “91,000 kids of color in CMS.”

**Olivia Scott:** Ran unsuccessfully in the past.  Hasn’t really campaigned or provided any useful information about herself or her candidacy though she did run in 2017 and editorials at the time seemed to suggest she could be a decent candidate. 

**Lenora Shipp** (age 61): Former teacher and principal in CMS, CMS graduate and CMS parent. The Charlotte Observer has also endorsed her. Her key areas of interest appear to be educational equity, school safety, more parent involvement, quality teachers and more elementary programs to support early achievement (in that order on her website). 

**Stephanie Sneed** (age 44): Attorney for child protective services, and has run for city council in the past.  Her site has a number of vague positions like “closing the achievement gap” and “providing support to teachers and staff.” 

**Duncan St. Clair** (age 42): He was a CMS student, his father was a longtime CMS teacher. He has extensive thoughts (though often generalized) on his website about most educational issues (e.g. city vs suburbs, climate change, safety and security). He wants to involve more parents (validating parking for parents who visit CMS was one thing he mentions on his website) but his positions do seem a bit out of touch with other candidates who talk about early education, minority students being left behind, etc. He also says that he is the owner of a small batch coffee company but it’s so small I’m not sure if he has another job to pay his bills. His LinkedIn profile has him as a park ranger and an insurance adjuster in his past. 

**Queen Thompson** (age 70+). Former CMS employee who “monitored federal compliance and coordinated services for students with special needs.” She has previously run for the board of education and county commissioner in the past.  She believes a large percent of students are victims of “educational malpractice.” 

**Monty Witherspoon** (age 39). A pastor at Steele Creeke AME Zion Church and former substitute teacher in NYC. He wants “all CMS graduates to be college or career ready.” Like several other candidates, he wants to increase the number of AP classes (I’m not sure why that is such a big deal unless you have excellent teachers who can help students get 4 or 5s on the tests. Many students have to supplement studying on their own anyway with online help so merely checking the box of APs doesn’t seem to be all that valuable.)

**Mecklenburg County Sales Tax**

This is a proposed hike in our sales tax of 0.25% so it should go up to 7.5% if this passes. There are [broad allocations](https://bettermecklenburg.com/) that this increase will support education, arts and our public parks. Opponents say that details on what will get funded, by how much and whether or not these issues are the most important ones that should get funded haven’t been provided.

I’m baffled why voters don’t demand and government officials don’t present such similar business plans for voters.",1572486283.0,CitizenProfane,"What's on the Nov 5 Election Ballot (and some thoughts on candidates)   

Please vote if you haven’t already. Here is the [election schedule](https://www.mecknc.gov/BOE/Documents/early%20voting%20calendar%20for%20MECK1911.pdf).  I talked to someone working at one of the early voting sites and he said that turnout has been slow so far. “Not enough controversy,” he sighed. Don’t let that deter you! Here is my latest recap of candidates for the upcoming election with my opinions as well (disagreement welcome in comments below--I want to hear other opinions to better inform myself.)  Quick note: I am in District 7 so I didn’t evaluate the other city council candidates who were not at-large but still running. 

**Mayoral Candidates**

**Vi Lyles** (incumbent): generally well-respected and known for being “pro Charlotte”; she’s been a civil servant working in the Charlotte government for decades; supported the RNC coming to Charlotte next year. It will be shocking if she doesn’t win as her competition is quite weak. 

**David Michael Rice:** Rice appears with regularity as a candidate for various roles in Charlotte (e.g. County Commissioner, City Council, mayor). He most recently ran for the role of Soil and Conservation District Supervisor in last year’s election.  He’s been unsuccessful to date and has said in the past he had [religious cable access TV show](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article41189799.html). He does not seem to be a “viable” opponent (no pun intended). He has also had a number of [financial problems](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article170248332.html) (bankrupty filings, liens against his property) dating back many years. 

**City Council at Large**

**Dimple Ajmera** (incumbent): a young relatively new council member; very liberal, endorsed by the Observer, very passionate in her positions related to women’s equality and economic development. 

**Julie Eiselt** (incumbent): also an experienced council member and is currently the Mayor Pro Tem. According to Charlotte’s city council website, “Julie had never envisioned a role in public office until a man tried to abduct her at gunpoint in 2007.  This led to her found Neighbors for a Safer Charlotte, to advocate for court-system resources and policies to make all Charlotte residents safer.” She has a reputation for being respected on the city council. 

**James (Smuggie) Mitchell** (incumbent) current member of the council having served on it for over 10 years; currently the chair of the economic development committee. He received the 2nd highest number of votes in the Democratic primary. 

**Joshua Richardson:** very young (age 21) candidate who describes himself as a Christian conservative. He said in an online survey that the person he looks up to most is Christ. There were a number of typos on his responses to [questions with Ballotopedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Joshua_Richardson) (e.g. “played lose (sic) with…”. He appears to have no work experience and there was no resume available online. (While he is the only at-large Republican candidate, that does NOT mean that the council is Republican-less. Ed Driggs represents District 7 and is a Republican who is running uncontested so there will absolutely still be a Republican on the council.) 

**Braxton Winston** (incumbent): relatively young and attended Davidson College and the elite New England prep school Phillips Andover; personal note—he was evidently trying to avoid being served divorce papers awhile back; his political career began when he was featured in the media during the Keith LaMott Scott riots and that put him in touch with community organizers; he realized he wanted to be involved in local politics then. His key issues are equity (housing equity, living wages for employees), access (mass transit, digital access), and interconnectedness (helping families particularly affected by the criminal justice system).  He received the highest number of votes in the Democratic primary. 

**City Council District 7**

**Ed Driggs** (incumbent): On his website he claims he wants “small, effective government” and believes that Charlotte has too much red tape for new businesses. Ed did not respond to my email so I am not sure how responsive he is to constituents or if he just didn’t get my emails. He also claims to have coffee every 7am on Fridays at the Ballantyne Hotel but I never saw him there when I went. He has been on the council for 6 years and positions himself as being one of the few Republican voices within the group. 

**Board of Education** 

**Annette Albright** (age 53): Albright was a behavior modification technician at Harding High School and reportedly was [assaulted by some students](https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/former-cms-worker-attacked-by-students-settles-with-district/733215605) which made the local news. She had filed a lawsuit against CMS for wrongful termination (she believes it was because she filed a worker’s comp claim) around that time and has run unsuccessfully for school board before. She appears to have several degrees in criminal justice. Regarding her platform, she says she wants to replace the Common Core and reduce overcrowding. (I will say as a CMS parent that the Common Core is not a bad thing—ensuring children have consistent education everywhere is a noble goal aspiring to equity. In my experience though, many schools cannot achieve the goals of the Common Core because the bar is high. I’d argue dumbing down our schools is not the answer though.) I’m also concerned that she wants more teachers fluent in the various languages of ESL students. Having had children in a language immersion program, it is very, very difficult to get multilingual teachers certified to teach public elementary school. That is a high bar, unnecessary and not the best use of limited school funds. 

**Elyse Dashew** (age 49, incumbent) Elyse’s children have been in CMS for years and she seems to be in the process of being groomed to be the Chairperson of the CMS board (she is Vice-Chairman now) but she also has been part of a group where transparency is missing. The current board mysteriously let Clayton Wilcox go with no explanation (the same board that presided over his pay raise just a few months prior). This incumbent board has also been light on answers with respect to details regarding school bonds and how it impacts current school programs. And in the school reassignment debate from a few years ago, details were also absent then as well. The board didn’t even shut down fears of parents who worried that their children may be reassigned to Huntersville if they lived in South Charlotte.  (I supposed vagaries are best because it gives less ammunition to oppose something.) She opposes vouchers for private schools and was the key leader behind the passing of the $1B school bond from a few years ago. We should demand more transparency from the board. Voting for Elyse probably won’t deliver that transparency. 

**Jennifer De La Jara** (age 45). Jennifer is a first-generation college graduate and wants to ensure “every child has access to quality public education.” She is the director of education at International House and a former ESL teacher in Cabarrus County. Her website states her support of education for “trades and IT” (where relevant in lieu of 4 year college degrees) and more Pre-K support. She has a number of endorsements including the Charlotte Observer and one of my favorite CMS educators, Justin Parmenter. She lives in Davidson now and pledges to support the views of the suburban Charlotte communities to have better access to CMS resources. 

**Gregory Denlea** (age 57). Former University of Phoenix teacher. Father of 3 who attended CMS. He also believes that CMS students face too much standardized testing. In an online survey, he also seemed to be dismayed by the “suburban flight” from CMS. I don’t understand why that is a problem if towns like Huntersville want to secede and become their own districts. His website states that he is particularly adamant about funding in the suburbs of towns like Mint Hill and Matthews (recall that those cities wanted to have their own magnets prioritizing residents which would be funded by Charlotte residents overall.) By my calculation, Huntersville, Matthews and Mint Hill have 13% of Charlotte’s population but likely pay 17% of the property taxes that fund the public schools; he has a point in trying to keep those suburbs within CMS.  

**Jenna Morehead** (age 48): Former school social worker who says she was the past president of a school board in another state (which she does not specify). She responded to an online survey somewhat quizzically. When asked what specific problems she saw with CMS, her answer was “I am currently not aware of specific issues or concerns.” Hmmm. She also says she is an advocate of free breakfast for students—something that CMS already provides. I really cannot recommend this candidate as she seems ill-informed about CMS’ issues. 

**Donna Parker-Tate** (age 68): Former educator (including school principal) and currently an educational consultant.  She had a lot of vague responses in an online survey but seems knowledgeable about CMS, charter schools and the differences between giving resources to low-performing schools while not hurting high-performing schools. 

**Jordan Pineda:** Former Teach for America teacher.  Much of his website talks about the gap in early education for children of color and opportunities provided to them. He says he wants to represent the “91,000 kids of color in CMS.”

**Olivia Scott:** Ran unsuccessfully in the past.  Hasn’t really campaigned or provided any useful information about herself or her candidacy though she did run in 2017 and editorials at the time seemed to suggest she could be a decent candidate. 

**Lenora Shipp** (age 61): Former teacher and principal in CMS, CMS graduate and CMS parent. The Charlotte Observer has also endorsed her. Her key areas of interest appear to be educational equity, school safety, more parent involvement, quality teachers and more elementary programs to support early achievement (in that order on her website). 

**Stephanie Sneed** (age 44): Attorney for child protective services, and has run for city council in the past.  Her site has a number of vague positions like “closing the achievement gap” and “providing support to teachers and staff.” 

**Duncan St. Clair** (age 42): He was a CMS student, his father was a longtime CMS teacher. He has extensive thoughts (though often generalized) on his website about most educational issues (e.g. city vs suburbs, climate change, safety and security). He wants to involve more parents (validating parking for parents who visit CMS was one thing he mentions on his website) but his positions do seem a bit out of touch with other candidates who talk about early education, minority students being left behind, etc. He also says that he is the owner of a small batch coffee company but it’s so small I’m not sure if he has another job to pay his bills. His LinkedIn profile has him as a park ranger and an insurance adjuster in his past. 

**Queen Thompson** (age 70+). Former CMS employee who “monitored federal compliance and coordinated services for students with special needs.” She has previously run for the board of education and county commissioner in the past.  She believes a large percent of students are victims of “educational malpractice.” 

**Monty Witherspoon** (age 39). A pastor at Steele Creeke AME Zion Church and former substitute teacher in NYC. He wants “all CMS graduates to be college or career ready.” Like several other candidates, he wants to increase the number of AP classes (I’m not sure why that is such a big deal unless you have excellent teachers who can help students get 4 or 5s on the tests. Many students have to supplement studying on their own anyway with online help so merely checking the box of APs doesn’t seem to be all that valuable.)

**Mecklenburg County Sales Tax**

This is a proposed hike in our sales tax of 0.25% so it should go up to 7.5% if this passes. There are [broad allocations](https://bettermecklenburg.com/) that this increase will support education, arts and our public parks. Opponents say that details on what will get funded, by how much and whether or not these issues are the most important ones that should get funded haven’t been provided. I must say that in my experience with Mecklenburg County (this is true about bonds too), there is very little detail. Voters are expected to approve things with very little detail on how beneficiaries were chosen, which regions will benefit or by how much. In the business world, no one gets money they ask for unless detailed business plans are drafted and presented. I’m baffled why voters don’t demand and government officials don’t present such similar business plans for voters.",neutral,nov election ballot thought candidate please vote already election schedule

Almost all of my work experience comes from tutor Teaching English was kind of a transition job from university and also a way to live in Spain to improve my Spanish. I reached a high proficiency in Spanish language by living there so I would love to figure out how to incorporate that into my life here, whether at a job, or in a friend group.

Basically, I feel overwhelmed by the drastic lifestyle change and wouldn't mind any advice, leads, or even a coffee at a cool place.

Thanks n have a gr8 day yall",positive,moved madrid spain looking teacher found work clt hi moved charlotte week ago living madrid past two year really need find meaningful feeling work trying stay service industry think ever work would love traditional work schedule health benefit hoping hear meet anyone something similar taught abroad came back usa found good place queen city basically studied sociology spanish nc state almost work experience come tutor teaching english kind transition job university also way live spain improve spanish reached high proficiency spanish language living would love figure incorporate life whether job friend group basically feel overwhelmed drastic lifestyle change would mind advice lead even coffee cool place thanks n day yall
The Scanner: NoDa Bonfire,"**BURNING UP** A recent Sunday Funday in NoDa turned into a fiery mess when a car burst into flames in front of Neighborhood Theatre. According to the report, the 28-year-old owner of the car stated that a woman intentionally set the car on fire while she was still inside, though it’s unclear how she did so. Photos of the scene posted on Facebook show the black Honda Civic flaming up pretty big, to the point where it was totaled, though the victim was fortunately able to escape suffering only minor injuries and did not need medical treatment. Two things that remain unclear from the photo and report: Why there’s an electric scooter underneath the car while it’s burning and which involved party is now facing drug charges for the $400 worth of Xanax that were found on the scene.

**LOSE YOUR HEAD** Police responded to a Golf Galaxy on Providence Road after a recent example of the most south Charlotte crime one could commit. Police responded to the store at around 6:45 p.m. one evening after an unknown suspect walked into the store and unscrewed the head of a golf club from its body and walked out with just the head, which is apparently worth $300.

**LEAVE A MARK** A 35-year-old man was assaulted at his job recently in a way that is more mafia don than car salesman. The victim told police he was at his job at Town & Country Toyota on South Boulevard at around 12:15 p.m. when his coworker grabbed him by the shirt and burned his neck with a lit cigar. It must have been the suspect’s lunch break, though, because he fled the scene before police arrived.

**WEIGHED DOWN** A porch pirate in south Charlotte probably thought they had made a big haul during a recent theft, only to find a blanket. According to a police report from one of Charlotte’s more affluent neighborhoods — which we won’t name so as not to make it a target — a 32-year-old man reported thousands of dollars worth of goods stolen from his porch after they were delivered by Amazon. The man reported the following as stolen: two ceramic fans, two air filters, a weighted blanket, a bed comforter, a knife set, a Roku, an Apple Watch, two vacuums, a juice machine, two phone cases and a dinner set. All in all, the thief made off with $2,700 in merchandise.

**E-COMMERCE** Management at a north Charlotte Walmart filed a police report recently after finding that one of their employees had been collecting on a holiday bonus that he didn’t necessarily earn. According to the report, the employee was found to have stolen 20 video games and a pair of AirPods during his three-month employment. If we’re being real, Walmart is known nationally for treating their workers like shit so we say let him keep the games.

**CAN’T BE CONTAINED** Police responded to a group home in the Windsor Park neighborhood after one juvenile proved to be too slippery for both staff and police both. According to the report, police had just “recovered” the runaway juvenile after he ditched the group home, and returned him to the building at around 10:30 p.m. Then, “while officers were still on scene, group home staff members informed officers that the juvenile had run away again.”

**STARTING A BAND** Police responded to a Guitar Center in University City on one recent morning after someone pulled off a daring heist and stole thousands of dollars worth of musical equipment. According to the report, at some point between 9:19 and 10:15 a.m., a suspect walked out of the store with four electric guitars, one bass guitar, one classical guitar and a case, stealing a total of $5,646 worth of gear.

**DAVY CROC-IT** One would-be shoplifter has to be wondering which is worse, his taste or his timing, after getting caught red-handed at a DSW shoe warehouse on South Boulevard one recent morning. According to the report, the suspect walked into the store at around 10:40 a.m. and grabbed a backpack from one of the shelves then put two pairs of Crocs in the bag. He ran out the front door and right into two police officers who were walking into the store. A brief foot pursuit followed, but the suspect was caught by the officers and charged with misdemeanor shoplifting.

**MOPEDING ISN’T A CRIME** Police responded to Saint Patrick Catholic School on a recent morning after an anonymous employee called 911 to report a “suspicious moped” that had been found near the school’s playground. We’re not sure what makes a moped suspicious, but we think Suspicious Moped would make a good band name if anyone wants it. As for the moped itself, it’s been placed in storage until ownership can be determined.

**WHEN NATURE CALLS** Perhaps the most conspicuous thing you can do to grab a cop’s attention when you happen to be driving drunk at 9 a.m. would be to jump out of your car and start peeing in the street during rush hour traffic, but that’s what one suspect did on a recent Monday morning. According to the report, officers witnessed the suspect urinating in the roadway on South Tryon Street near Sandy Porter Road, so they pulled him over and, following an investigation, charged him with driving while impaired and other traffic-related offenses.

**OUTTA MY YARD** One south Charlotte man doesn’t want anybody messing around in his yard, even if they’re trying to improve it. Police responded to an assault call in the Quail Hollow neighborhood and found two men, aged 63 and 23, who had just been in a fight. According to the report, the 63-year-old man who owned the home where the call originated yelled at the younger man, who is a landscaper and was doing yardwork. The older man ordered him to leave his yard. The landscaper must really love his job, because he refused to leave the yard, then “an altercation ensued \[and\] the resident struck the landscaper in the face with a closed fist.”

LPT: Dan Nicholas Park in Salisbury is an amazing value if you have kids,"We just returned from our second trip to Dan Nicholas Park in Salisbury with our little one and are still in awe of what you get for a few dollars there. We played in all 3 of their playgrounds, rode a train, the carousel, saw barnyard animals, watched snakes in the nature center, played in the splash pad, and had a picnic for under $10.

They also have mini golf, a zoo, gem mine, and paddle boats but we haven't checked those out yet. It's a bit far, was 45 minutes strait up 85 from University City, but well worth it and that gives our kid time for a nap afterwards.

Prices are on their site, https://www.rowancountync.gov/186/Attractions, but everything is about $1 per person. Bring cash and they do have some concessions but not much so you may want to bring drinks and snacks. Some areas like the zoo can be hot but a lot of the park is well shaded.

Best location and time to visit DMV?,"Hello,

I am new to the area and need to get my driver’s license and vehicle registration sorted in the next few weeks.

I have tried calling to make an appointment to get an NC license and I’m always met with a message about unusually high call volumes and to call back later. 

Can anyone provide insight into the best options here? I have accepted that I’ll probably burn several hours of my day going through these processes if I just show up at a location and wait, but I want to make sure that if I do show up, that I’m able to take care of what I need to take care of and don’t need to come back.

TIA for any input!

Edit: I really appreciate everyone's input.  I was up early today so I decided to go to the University City DMV to attempt to get my NC driver's license.  I arrived at 7:15 and there were probably 25 people in line, some of which were together.  The doors opened at 8AM. I was assigned a ticket by 8:15 after proving I had all the required documents.  I was called to see an agent before I even had a chance to sit down.  15 minutes later and $58 poorer, I walked out the door as a licensed driver and registered voter in North Carolina.",1568816587.0,JammPot,"Best location and time to visit DMV?

**WHAT STINKS?** CMPD and the Charlotte Fire Department responded to Tuckaseegee Park in west Charlotte one recent morning after it was found that someone had set a porta-potty on fire overnight and let it burn, which I’m including in this column only in case you need an expression for something that’s even worse than a dumpster fire. The Trump administration, for example.

**HOTBOX** A school bus was cleared out on one recent afternoon after an elementary school student chose the wrong time to test out their pepper spray. According to the report, “The juvenile suspect sprayed pepper spray onto the floor of the school bus causing three other juveniles to be affected.” The kids who were “affected” were not injured, however, and the young suspect was not charged. Damn kid, when I was young we just made stink bombs and left it at that.

**BAIT AND SWITCH** A 20-year-old woman filed a police report after she was teased with some money then robbed of her cellphone. The woman said she had placed the phone up for sale on the letgo app, then met with a man who claimed he wanted to buy it. When she met the him at a Public Storage on Albemarle Road, he flashed money at her to gain her trust, then suddenly grabbed her phone and ran off. The victim told police the man tripped and fell, then got up and ran through traffic and into the woods before disappearing for good.

 **GROUNDED** Police have been perturbed by a couple of mystery drone pilots who have been breaking the laws of the land … er, air. In November, CMPD and the FAA reported that someone in the Selwyn Park area had been flying their machine in restricted Class B airspace. The pilot flew the drone 1,500 feet in the air, more than triple the maximum allowed 400 feet, which is considered what’s necessary to keep the drone in the pilot’s line of sight. Then in December, the FAA filed another report stating that someone in the First Ward area flew their drone 1,100 feet up and came down in Bank of America Stadium.

**SIX-SHOT DONATION** The manager at a Goodwill store on Wilkinson Boulevard in west Charlotte called police after an inventory check turned up something that didn’t need to be resold. According to the manager, someone had anonymously donated a revolver to the store. He said that he is unsure of the date at which they received the firearm because it had been donated “a while ago,” but he had just come across it while checking inventory recently. Good to know.

**WHAT’S EVEN REAL** If you can’t trust the people who are robbing you, who can you trust? Police responded to an armed robbery call in east Charlotte just before midnight and found four suspects who had tried to rob one 49-year-old man, and still felt like they needed plenty of firepower to do it. According to the report, the suspects used a very real black Ruger .380 pistol and a toy assault rifle painted black, apparently just for the extra intimidation factor.

**DARK MAN X** A 41-year-old man was robbed in the Enderly Park neighborhood of west Charlotte recently, and the thieves made off with two of his necklaces. When asked to give a description of one of the pieces of jewelry, the victim told officers it was a platinum chain “like what DMX wears.” Well, that narrows it down.

**SOMETHING’S LOOSE** A 63-year-old truck driver living in University City filed a police report after becoming convinced that someone was trying to sabotage his vehicle. The man told police that someone had loosened all eight lug nuts on the right front wheel of his semi. He didn’t believe that anyone was trying to steal the tire or anything, but did note that, “the loosening of the lugs resulted in oil loss from the plate that houses the wheel bearings.”

**DUNKED ON** If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. A 31-year-old man thought he landed a sweet job where he could make money from doing nothing, but in the end he was scammed out of thousands of dollars. The man told police that the scammer hired him to advertise for Dunkin’ Donuts by wrapping his car with a DD ad. The suspect sent him a check to pay for the wrap, and was asked to return payment through Zelle and Google gift cards. He repaid the $3,900 that he was told the wrap costed, only to then find out that the original check he received was counterfeit.

**HOLE IN ONE** A bad day only got worse for a 31-year-old Concord man who had to have his car towed from Remount Road during rush hour on a recent afternoon. The man told police he was waiting next to his Infiniti G35 when suddenly a golf ball came flying from the nearby Charles L. Sifford Golf Course at Revolution Park and went right through his rear windshield.

**QUIET DOWN** An overzealous shoplifter blew her own cover at Sephora in Northlake Mall on a recent morning, but still got away with the goods. According to staff, a look back at surveillance footage showed that the woman had entered the store just before 10:30 a.m. and walked to the fragrance section. She selected a few, then walked to a corner where she felt comfortable placing them in her purse. She then went back for more, but this time when she got to the corner, she made a bunch of noise while removing a bottle from its packaging, which drew a salesperson to ask if she needed help. The shoplifter declined and quickly left the store with 12 bottles of fragrance, valued at a total of $1,560.

**HOLE IN ONE** A bad day only got worse for a 31-year-old Concord man who had to have his car towed from Remount Road during rush hour on a recent afternoon. The man told police he was waiting next to his Infiniti G35 when suddenly a golf ball came flying from the nearby Charles L. Sifford Golf Course at Revolution Park and went right through his rear windshield.

**QUIET DOWN** An overzealous shoplifter blew her own cover at Sephora in Northlake Mall on a recent morning, but still got away with the goods. According to staff, a look back at surveillance footage showed that the woman had entered the store just before 10:30 a.m. and walked to the fragrance section. She selected a few, then walked to a corner where she felt comfortable placing them in her purse. She then went back for more, but this time when she got to the corner, she made a bunch of noise while removing a bottle from its packaging, which drew a salesperson to ask if she needed help. The shoplifter declined and quickly left the store with 12 bottles of fragrance, valued at a total of $1,560.

Looking for stuff to do with my introvert roommate who needs some social contact and self-worth.,"When I say he's an introvert, I'm not saying he's an anti-social, neckbeard shut-in. Life has shit on him. He is twenty years old. His parents have cut him off entirely, so he can't go to college anymore, and he doesn't talk to his family at all. So all he really has is me, my immediate family, and some close mutual friends. 

I'm looking for some stuff that he (and I because he does not have a car) can do in the city that would help feel better about himself. He has a job at UPS that is bringing in steady income, buuuut he works every week day from 5pm-10pm, so he is very nocturnal and exhausted during most daylight hours. 

He and I also LURVES animals, but we can't have any at our place, so if there any sort of places that we could pet or be around dogs that would be cool. 

Also despite being a quiet guy, he's actually pretty cool and not bad looking, and I think if he found a lady friend he'd be pretty happy. I don't think there's any way I could get him to consider online dating, any ideas on where to meet geeky, dog loving women during le weekend?

"Just finished knocking 1,000 doors in the district. I took a few notes.","Summer is officially over, and so is my project of knocking on 1,000 doors in the district. I met a lot of great people and learned a lot about what they're really thinking.

I thought I'd share a few notes I took along the way.

**************************

Door 1: ""We don't have to agree on every point. I just need to know you actually care.""

Door 168: ""If people knew our family's story it would change the way they think about health care. It's not just numbers - it's about real people.""

Door 390: Had a good talk about redistricting, education funding, and (naturally) Trump.

Lesson: In my door-knocking experience, purple doors belong to friendly people. Not stereotyping, just saying it's universally true.

Door 465: Ring bell. 10,000 dogs start barking. Door cracks. ""Yes?"" ""Hi, I'm Jeff, I'm your state sen-"" ""Ok, I'll Google you."" Door shuts.

Door 466: Ring bell. Can't hear it, not sure if it works. Wait, then knock. Door opens: ""Yeah, I heard the bell."" ""Oh. Sorry. I'm Jeff.""

Door 467: Knows me, invites me in, we talk about licensing regulations for architecture. Gives me his card, says call anytime.

Door 615 just invited me in for dinner, but I gotta keep knocking. Tippah Ave is setting the bar pretty high for overall friendliness today.

Door 820: ""Hi I'm-"" ""You're Jeff Jackson. What door number am I?"" ""820."" ""820. That's a good number. Keep going.""

Door 828: Great conversation about the trade-offs between tax cuts and education funding. Connection is basically direct in NC.

Door 833: Talking to young mom when her toddler runs out of the bathroom holding end of toilet paper and unrolls it all the way to the door.

Door 850: ""Great neighborhood. Too many Democrats.""

Door 853: ""Great neighborhood. Too many Republicans.""

Door 920: Just got myself into a situation where I'm trying to explain the electoral college to an 8-year-old. I think I did a really bad job.

Door 944: ""Yep, I voted for you, I just don't want to talk right now. It's not you, it's the Panthers.""

Door 976: ""I get that it's hard to do an outstanding job as an elected official. But it's not hard to not be terrible. Don't be terrible.""

Lesson: A big part of going door-to-door is dog management. Basically, the dog is never wrong. Jumping, slobbering, crazy loud barking - it all has to be ok.

Door 1,000: And... no one home. I had a little speech ready and everything. Was gonna post the selfie. But, leaving a pamphlet.

Spectrum.. this is my story,"Hello...my name is Robert.Ive been a Spectrum customer for over 6 years. The first 5 years having service through Spectrum, I was a satisfied with my service. Before I start, it's fair that I give you some insight on my background. Im a professional exterminator for one of the biggest and most reputable companies in the United States. That being said, I'm noone important. I'm just an ordinary blue collar that provides and utilizes my knowledge to provide the best customer service within my job title. I was a gamer in my spare time, and for the last 6 months my internet speed and cable has been experiencing issues. To be quite fair, the area that I reside in has experienced 2 lightning strikes very close to where I live. When I turn my cable on I experience horrible delay as simple as just changing channels. Not only that but I experience the worst lag, freeze, and packet loss to the point where online gaming is completely impossible. That is when I contacted Spectrum support for help. This is my story.
I had scheduled 4 different times for a technician to be at my home. All 4 times after receiving notifications of ETA an arrival noone ever came to service  anything. I called back a ""5th"" time. I repeated my name address state ect. so many times that at one point I truly thought I was being pranked. I spoke to multiple customer service personnel Manager's, Janitors, Security. I spoke to one guy I'm not sure his title. We conversated about his unique ability to catch Pokemon with his friends and all the different video games he plays, and I shared the ones that I used to play before experiencing problems with my connection and cable. At one point I was transferred somewhere in space and time to a guy who really seemed to be tech savvy, I will call this man Chief. Chief ran a diagnostic test, he informed me that from the Enterprise Command Center that our equipment and boxes showed no activity. From my end, nothing had changed. I hadn't moved my equipment or nothing was disconnected. Chief walked me through all the self troubleshooting steps, but everything on my end seemed to be running. He asked me if I wanted to make an appointment to have a Spectrum Technician come to my home.... So, let me get this straight Chief, you have been square dealin with me. So for the past 5 months I've been paying for a service that I'm not receiving. There was a brief pause before he cleared his throat and said ""Yes Sir"". I took a moment for myself, I asked myself a series of questions trying figure out all the Why's and sorting all the How's. I thought about all the series of performance connection tests I've ran on my PS4. All I could think about was 1.4 Mbps upload speed. And trying to switch channels on my cable, only to see it skip channels freeze on channels which caused me to flip to the adult channels uncontrollably. While sorting my thoughts and a series of sighs and hmm haws.. Chief interrupts my saying... Sir I'm going transfer you to retention. Hey, oh, wait!!! I suddenly hear the Spectrum music hit,  and just like that.. Chief was gone. Chief had sent me to retention, I'm obviously not as smart or as clever that I thought I was. I began to wonder what was retention, honestly retention sounded a bit like detention. And judging by the repetitive recording of the bot woman talking to me, and being serenaded by the iconic Spectrum music, maybe was in for it. I had time to think 30 minutes or so, I thought about alot of things. I thought about retention, I spent time reminiscing on how to spell reminiscing to write this story. I thought about how cool it would be to gaming. Discovering new things in open world gaming, random thoughts. I expanded my thoughts a little deeper when I popped my 6th beer of the evening. I thought about the possibility of a huge lag monster hidden in retention, where I would need my Master of the Universe sword while riding battle cat into the depths of Lagoon. My thoughts were instantly broken by a woman's voice. What can I help you with? ... I'm instantly startled by the woman's voice. I had been snapped out of my fantastic virtual world which upset me a little bit. This is the gate keeper of retention, the beer and mixture of imagination was too much for my intermonlog. For whatever reason I didn't want to say my name, last name, middle initial, Country, City, Zip code, State. All of those things paved the way to retention, the forbidden place of unknown. The place where customers go who are late paying their monthly bill. A place where all the customers go that are misfits, the unwanted. I'm Bob, they call me Bob The Bug Mane, I wanted to enter retention with a reputation with a name. And if Bob The Bug Mane is what it takes to get back on the international superhighway gets me there, I'm rolling with it. Proud of myself I sit and waited for the gate keeper to respond. Go ahead I thought to myself snuggly, tell me something I haven't heard. There was a strange pause, a silence. A kind of pause that almost reminded me being young again. Where the whole family sits at the table together and Grandpa hasn't taken his medication. When out of nowhere Grandpa slams his plate and randomly cusses and berates every person in the family and we are all trying continue to eat. I knew retention was my final destination, the end of this journey. The Gatekeeper began to speak something about some terms and conditions, troubleshooting, self help books. I am listening, however I find myself standing over the toilet taking a whizz and hearing the gate keeper rattle on about this that and the other, and what not. 5 hours has taken it toll on Bob the Bug Mane, the beer and time invested. She says something about dysnch, and I'm thinking about how that sounds like a snake that lives in retention with the lag monster. I picture deep down under the Enterprise Command Center all the missing people that gave up the good fight. I had somehow eluded the Gate keeper, the dust had cleared. I stood or actually sat quitely red eyed and beaten. Bob the Bug Mane had one final battle a ""MANAGER"". Yes, ladies and gentlemen. After nearly falling into my drunken stupor, and listening to the Spectrum theme music again. I thought I was at a New Kids On The Block concert. Jordan Knight sounded like the automated woman talking and Donnie Wahlberg was  inspiring my final moments on the Enterprise Command Center by singing hanging tough. A Manager answered the phone. I simply explained that Chief had ran diagnostic tests on my boxes and from the Enterprise Command Center he was showing that my equipment wasn't online. I told him that I made 4 different appointments for a technician to service inside my home. I explained to him for the past 5 months that I'm paying 230$ for service that I'm not receiving. He offered me 20$ off my next cycled bill as compensation for my loss. Totally disregarding the fact that 4 scheduled appointments were cancelled. I called to find out why.. not one person at the Enterprise Command Center could ever tell me why. I took it upon myself to replace all my equipment because the equipment that I had was out of date. However, that did nothing to fix my problem. I have called other providers but nothing runs in my area but Spectrum. In conclusion, I'm a technician for a pest control company. If I send an ETA, I better hit that window in a respectable time give or take. If I sent an ETA for service and just didn't go at all, I would have no job. I would be receiving calls from our office and my boss would be finding out. If we receive trouble calls, those calls are sent to our technicians in that particular area and is top priority.

My Eastland Proposal,"There's a property that the city owns on the East side of the city that NO ONE knows what to do with (Eastland Mall). It's a diverse, yet poor neighborhood. All other plans for the site have fallen through and it remains essentially a parking lot.

I don't have kids. But I do have a vested interest in education. We all do. We need to make sure we have an economically and culturally flourishing society for the years to come. I have major, major problems with the direction of education over the last 100 years.

We have and continue to raise kids to learn four subjects (Math, English, Science and sometimes History). We say this is what time you show up. This is what you wear. Listen to your teacher/boss. We raise generation after generation of worker bees and lament the lack of creativity. Of course we're not a creative society -- we have stifled it out of the most creative individuals in our society -- the children!

We start asking kids at 5 years old, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" This is a one dimensional question. No wonder no one can answer it even as adults. There are a very few people who grow up knowing they want to be a firefighter. Most of us stumble through school, college and our careers looking for something that instills passion.

We do not expose children to enough subjects. If we teach personal finance, aren't we teaching math with it? If we teach how to build a bicycle, don't they need to learn physics and pi? How can we continue to over-test, over-work and stress out these great, budding minds and not take the time to shepherd them to find an inner passion? How can we possibly train children for a work force when we don't have any idea what that work force will look like in 5 years, let alone 20?

Steve Jobs dropped out of college, yet remained on campus wandering from class to class and just looked for subjects that interested him. One of those subjects was calligraphy. Hardly a useful skill. Until you're building a personal computer and decide that you're going to invent fonts.

The next generations won't be excelling in singular fields. They'll be marrying AI with cooking. Robotics with surgery. Instead of teaching four subjects, we need to teach 400. Learn how to cook, how credit works, entrepreneurship. Teach dance, painting, civics. Find and instill a passion for learning no matter what the subjects are.

We don't need an education evolution. We need an education REVOLUTION.

So I'd like to propose (to anyone that listens) that Charlotte develops this Eastland Mall location to be a world-class education campus. Funded by private means because, once again, we all have a vested interest in the next generation.

-We need to stop gating our adult education behind community colleges and universities. We should offer adult education and vocational training 52 weeks of the year. It should be 100% free and not time-gated by semester. We should offer classes on personal finance, English and Spanish as a second language, cooking and parenting while also training plumbers and mechanics. Come and take classes when you can.

-We should use a severely under utilized asset as teachers -- senior citizens. We have millions of them in this country willing to volunteer and they have something to teach us all. Seniors need to pass on the education and PASSION they have. We will shuttle them onto campus or beam them in through Skype.

-We should have a research center whose only mission is to find, cultivate and implement any tool that will make education easier and more effective.

-A K-12 public school on campus that believes in thinking outside the box and restores emphasis developing individual passion in order to instill a lifelong thirst for more knowledge.

To reiterate, any class you want to teach and we'll find a room for you to teach in. Any class you want to take will be 100% free and you're welcome anytime. All lessons get posted online for free viewing. We will teach you and your child in the same class. We will offer child care for babies and toddlers while parents are in class. We will educate work skills as well as life skills. Your children will go to school and be exposed to enough subjects that we will find their talents. Teachers will become shepherds of passion.

We will, in short, create a better society. How could anyone be opposed to this?

Board gaming session reports!,"First, I think the wife and I are planning on heading out to Carowinds this weekend, and we hope to meet many of you, familiar or not. And, of course, it's a good opportunity to meet us so that we can talk you into what's turned into a very consistent and successful weekly game night!

So, come to Carowinds but, more importantly, come to game night!

So tonight it was me, my wife, missllil, and a_drive, and also a LOT of food that my wife had prepared (either a bit overzealously, or perhaps simply to get it out of our fridge).

We started out with a_drive's thrift find (I think), 221B Baker Street ... and H.G. Wells' Time Machine! It's a game in which you roll a die to move around the board and arrive at locations to gather clues and, eventually, piece together various bits of necessary information. a_drive started off and missllil followed him pretty faithfully, blocking me off. My wife went in a completely direction (and I eventually joined her). Eventually, I made a guess as to the particular conspiracy. Well, I was wrong (I got two of the four key information wrong, and completely guessed at one I got right). Turns out that I bit on a red herring pretty much immediately. a_drive guessed right after me and then pretty much mapped out the solution exactly as outlined in the solution book. And got the victory.

After this we broke out Metropolys, a relatively light game that I enjoyed a fair amount. Players are bidding to secure a city district, but players are not bidding on the same districts, but rather consecutively bidding on districts with a certain spatial element (it's hard to explain). Which is to say, of course, that it's not a purely straightforward auction. Also, we all have a pair of secret objectives. One objective that each player has is simply bonus points for occupying a certain color of district (different for all players) and it became apparent pretty quickly what everybody help (except for maybe me? I wasn't going super aggressively after red). The other objective is, broadly, controlling a certain ""feature"". a_drive was aggressive early, my wife and I got some big, solid bids in sporadically. missllil had been slow-playing and then claimed several districts all in a flurry, and managed to snag further districts to put her in threat of ending the game. My wife, throughout, thought I had a different objective than I actually had. And then, eventually, I set a_drive up to end the game (by occupying a valuable district, no less). Final scoring: we all occupied roughly the same amount of personal bonus districts (10-10-10-12, missllil's favor), and things remained close after the ""feature"" bonus (22-22-20-19, a_drive and me leading, missllil trailing). However, I had collected numerous ""trendy districts"", the ""metro"" bonus, and a tallest building bonus to end up at 43. missllil had two tallest building bonuses among a smattering of trendy neighborhoods to end up at 38. a_drive had one tallest building, but not much beyond that to end up 33. My wife had been a bit cavalier about building in (negative valued) archaeological sites such that she only ended up with 26. I won!

missllil's headache required something ... lighter ... and so we played Dixit. It was a pretty good round (there was, I believe, only one universal ""gimme"" that all players guessed, and I was the storyteller). I generally guessed well and took an early lead, but it remained close, except missllil lagged. a_drive eventually took a pretty solid lead and I ended up guessing his card correctly to give him the win, even though I got three points for my guess and two additional for a good decoy.

Finally, likely against some better judgment, we tackled a learning session of Dungeon Petz (which is similar to Agricola in some regards). I tried a rules explanation, and missllil's eyes glazed over, so we learned as we played .... missllil and a_drive went aggressively after artifacts (missllil taking six, a_drive ending up with the remaining four). I instead went pretty hard after the actual pets (and, of course, cages to occupy them), turning over quite a few pets over the course of the game. My wife, alternatively, went for a few, manageable pets and additionally the resources to care for them. Because of all my pets (and trying to spread out my actions) I had some serious trouble tending them, and accumulated quite a bit of manure, and a few suffering cubes (and I felt appropriately guilty!). The others were generally completely tending to their pets (my wife fed, I think, never had to feed, and a_drive fed just once; missllil had an aggressive anti-manure strategy, etc.). I think missllil was, in part, at sea on this game and also fading fast (as was my wife ...). And so we showed our pets (petz?) and eventually sold them (my wife had an early 18 point sale from the podium). But on the last turn my wife loaded a pet up with disease and manure to make it worth extremely little. I managed to sell twice from the podium for some pretty solid points. a_drive could only sell a single pet, but it was a well tended pet (the other was too young) and missllil sold just for the hell of it. Final scores: a_drive was something like 63, having led for most of the game and having a consistently strong exhibition strategy. I was in second, having had a strong push from my late sales ... for a second I thought I was going to win. My wife was just five points or so behind me at 53, and missllil hadn't managed to lap 50. I think (maybe?) the consensus was that this was a good game, but not when you wrap it up just 10 minutes short of 1am.

And then we discovered Amendment One had passed. For shame, NC.
